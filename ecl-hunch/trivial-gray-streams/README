trivial-gray-streams
====================

This system provides an extremely thin compatibility layer for gray
streams.  It is nearly *too* trivial for a complete package, except that
I have copy&pasted this code into enough projects now that I decided to
factor it out once again now, and then *never* have to touch it again.


How to use it
=============

1. Use the package TRIVIAL-GRAY-STREAMS instead of whatever
   implementation-specific package you would have to use otherwise to
   get at gray stream symbols.
2. For STREAM-READ-SEQUENCE and STREAM-WRITE-SEQUENCE, notice that we
   use two required arguments and allow additional keyword arguments.
   So the lambda list when defining a method on either function should look
   like this:
     (stream sequence start end &key)
3. In order for (2) to work on all Lisps, make sure to subclass all your
   stream classes from TRIVIAL-GRAY-STREAM-MIXIN if you intend to define
   methods on those two generic functions.


Extensions
==========

Generic function STREAM-READ-SEQUENCE (stream sequence start end &key)
Generic function STREAM-WRITE-SEQUENCE (stream sequence start end &key)

	See above.

Generic function STREAM-FILE-POSITION (stream) => file position
Generic function (SETF STREAM-FILE-POSITION) (position-spec stream) => successp

	Will only be called by LispWorks and CLISP.

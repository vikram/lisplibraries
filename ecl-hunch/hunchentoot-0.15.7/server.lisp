  "Starts a Hunchentoot server and returns the SERVER object \(which
can be stopped with STOP-SERVER).  PORT is the port the server will be
listening on - the default is 80 \(or 443 if SSL information is
provided).  If ADDRESS is a string denoting an IP address, then the
server only receives connections for that address.  This must be one
of the addresses associated with the machine and allowed values are
host names such as \"www.nowhere.com\" and address strings like
\"204.71.177.75\".  If ADDRESS is NIL, then the server will receive
connections to all IP addresses on the machine.  This is the default.

DISPATCH-TABLE can either be a dispatch table which is to be used by
this server or NIL which means that at request time *META-DISPATCHER*
will be called to retrieve a dispatch table.

NAME should be a symbol which can be used to name the server.  This
name can utilized when defining \"easy handlers\" - see
DEFINE-EASY-HANDLER.  The default name is an uninterned symbol as
returned by GENSYM.

If MOD-LISP-P is true, the server will act as a back-end for mod_lisp,
otherwise it will be a stand-alone web server.  If USE-APACHE-LOG-P is
true, log messages will be written to the Apache log file - this
parameter has no effect if MOD-LISP-P is NIL.

If INPUT-CHUNKING-P is true, the server will accept request bodies
without a `Content-Length' header if the client uses chunked transfer
encoding.  If you want to use this feature together with mod_lisp, you
should make sure that your combination of Apache and mod_lisp can do
that - see:

  <http://common-lisp.net/pipermail/mod-lisp-devel/2006-December/000104.html>.

On LispWorks 5.0 or higher and AllegroCL, READ-TIMEOUT and
WRITE-TIMEOUT are the read and write timeouts \(in seconds) of
the server - use NIL for no timeout at all.  (See the LispWorks
documentation for STREAM:SOCKET-STREAM for details.)  On
LispWorks 4.4.6 or lower, SBCL, and CMUCL WRITE-TIMEOUT is
ignored.  On OpenMCL both parameters are ignored.

On Unix you can use SETUID and SETGID to change the UID and GID of the
process directly after the server has been started.  \(You might want
to do this if you're using a privileged port like 80.)  SETUID and
SETGID can be integers \(the actual IDs) or strings \(for the user and
group name respectively).

If you want your server to use SSL you must provide the pathname
designator\(s) SSL-CERTIFICATE-FILE for the certificate file and
optionally SSL-PRIVATEKEY-FILE for the private key file, both files
must be in PEM format.  If you only provide the value for
SSL-CERTIFICATE-FILE it is assumed that both the certificate and the
private key are in one file.  If your private key needs a password you
can provide it through the SSL-PRIVATEKEY-PASSWORD keyword argument,
but this works only on LispWorks - for other Lisps the key must not be
associated with a password."

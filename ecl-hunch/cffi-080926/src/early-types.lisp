;;;# Early Type Definitions
;;;
;;; This module contains basic operations on foreign types.  These
;;; definitions are in a separate file because they may be used in
;;; compiler macros defined later on.

(in-package #:cffi)

;;;# Foreign Types
;;;
;;; Type specifications are of the form (type {args}*). The type
;;; parser can specify how its arguments should look like through a
;;; lambda list.
;;;
;;; "type" is a shortcut for "(type)", ie, no args were specified.
;;;
;;; Examples of such types: boolean, (boolean), (boolean :int) If the
;;; boolean type parser specifies the lambda list: &optional
;;; (base-type :int), then all of the above three type specs would be
;;; parsed to an identical type.
;;;
;;; Type parsers, defined with DEFINE-PARSE-METHOD should return a
;;; subtype of the foreign-type class.

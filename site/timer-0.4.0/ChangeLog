	* Made 0.4.0 release.

	* queue.lisp: Made priority-queue-remove permissive about removing
	an item that might not be in the priority queue.

	* timers.lisp: Removed the no-longer-needed scheduled-p field from
	the timer struct.

	* scheduler.lisp: Completely reworked scheduling system to reduce
	locking complexity. Also, change the notion of
	sufficiently-short-as-to-be-nonexistent timeout from 0 to a small
	but nonzero value. This eliminates a problem with timers with a
	very small repeat time.

	* Made 0.3.2 release.

	* time.lisp: Changed GET-PRECISE-TIME to do a floating division
	instead of a rational coercion, which speeds it up about 5x.

2003-11-13  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* timers.lisp, scheduler.lisp: Move expire-timer from timers to
	scheduler.

	* timer.asd: Added version info.

	* scheduler.lisp: Wrap enable-timers operation in a mutex to
	prevent multiple scheduler threads.

2003-11-12  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* doc/index.html: Cleaned up the abstract a little bit, added a
	HTML head and title.

	* Made 0.3.1 release.

	* scheduler.lisp: Add a new path for rescheduling a repeating
	timer, and don't repeat a timer that's been unscheduled.

	* timers.lisp: Reschedule repeating timers via a different path
	than new timers.

	* Made 0.3 release.

	* scheduler.lisp: Unscheduling a timer failed to remove it from
	the queue of incoming timers. Fixed.
	%INCOMING-POP did not check to see if the condition it was waiting
	for actually occurred. Fixed.

	* queue.lisp: Fixed priority-queue-remove to use the right :key
	and :test argument to the underlying heap-extract.

2003-11-09  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* queue.lisp: Deleted queue and atomic queue stuff, since it's
	simplified in scheduler.lisp.

	* doc/index.html: Added info about download and installation, and
	about what happens if a scheduled timer is scheduled again.

	* scheduler.lisp (with-optional-timeout): Signal TIMEOUT when
	given a timeout less than or equal to zero.

	* time.lisp (get-precise-time): Switch from UNIX-GETTIMEOFDAY to
	the more portable GET-INTERNAL-REAL-TIME.

	* doc/index.html: Fixed stray &key and &optional formatting.

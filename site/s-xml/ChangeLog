2005-08-30 Sven Van Caekenberghe <svc@mac.com>

	* added Debian packaging directory (contributed by Luca Capello luca@pca.it)
	* added experimental XML namespace support 

2005-02-03 Sven Van Caekenberghe <svc@mac.com>

        * release 5 (cvs tag RELEASE_5)
	* added :start and :end keywords to print-string-xml
	* fixed a bug: in a tag containing whitespace, like <foo> </foo> the parser collapsed 
	  and ingnored all whitespace and considered the tag to be empty!
          this is now fixed and a unit test has been added
	* cleaned up xml character escaping a bit: single quotes and all normal whitespace  
	  (newline, return and tab) is preserved a unit test for this has been added
	* IE doesn't understand the &apos; XML entity, so I've commented that out for now. 
	  Also, using actual newlines for newlines is probably better than using #xA, 
	  which won't get any end of line conversion by the server or user agent.

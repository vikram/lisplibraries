BRIEF DESCRIPTION
-----------------
uffi is a Common Lisp package for interfacing C-language compatible
libraries. Every Common Lisp implementation has a method for
interfacing to such libraries. Unfortunately, these method vary widely
amongst implementations. uffi gathers a common subset of functionality
between Common Lisp implementations. uffi wraps this common subset of
functionality into it's own syntax and provides macro translation of
uffi features into the specific syntax of supported Common Lisp
implementations.

Currently, AllegroCL (Linux and Microsoft Windows), Lispworks (Linux
and Microsoft Windows), CMUCL, SBCL, and OpenMCL are supported.

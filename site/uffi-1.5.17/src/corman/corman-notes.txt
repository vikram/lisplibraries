some notes:
  we need the :pascal (:stdcall) calling conventions for 
  (def-function names args &key module returning calling-convention)
  so I added this. calling-convention defaults to :cdecl
  but on win32 we mostly use :stdcall

  #+corman is invalid, #+cormanlisp instead

  cormanlisp doesn't need to load and register the dll, since the underlying 
  LoadLibrary() call does this. we need the module keyword for def-function
instead.
  (should probably default to kernel32.dll)
  I'll think about library.cl, but we'll need more real-world win32 examples. 
  (ideally the complete winapi :)
  I also have to look at valentina.

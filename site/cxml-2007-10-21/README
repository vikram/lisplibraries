Closure XML Parser

   An XML parser written in Common Lisp.

   Closure XML was written by Gilbert Baumann (unk6 at
   rz.uni-karlsruhe.de) as part of the Closure web browser.

   Contributions to the parser by
     * Henrik Motakef (hmot at henrik-motakef.de)
     * David Lichteblau (david@lichteblau.com)

   CXML implements a namespace-aware, validating XML 1.0 parser
   as well as the DOM Level 2 Core interfaces. Two parser interfaces
   are offered, one SAX-like, the other similar to StAX.

   CXML is licensed under Lisp-LGPL.

<documentation title="CXML XMLS Compatibility">
    <h1>XMLS Builder</h1>
    <p>
      Like other XML parsers written in Lisp, CXML can work with
      documents represented as list structures. The specific model
      implemented by cxml is compatible with the <a
      href="http://common-lisp.net/project/xmls/">xmls parser</a>.  Xmls
      list structures are a simpler and faster alternative to full DOM
      document trees.  They also serve as an example showing how to
      implement user-defined document models as an independent layer
      over the the base parser (c.f. <tt>xml/xmls-compat.lisp</tt> in
      the cxml distribution).  However, note that the list structures do
      not include all information available in DOM documents
      (notably, things like <tt>dom:parent-node</tt>) and are
      sometimes more difficult to work with because of that since many
      DOM functions cannot be implemented on them.

      <b>New namespace handling:</b>
      XMLS compatibility is not <i>bug-for-bug</i>-compatible with
      XMLS any more.  There is now a mode using pairs of local name
      and namespace URI, and a second mode using qualified names
      only.  The old behaviour using pairs of prefix and local names
      was removed.

    <p>
      <strike>
	fixme: It is unclear to me how namespaces are meant to
	work in xmls, since xmls documentation differs from how xmls
	actually works in current releases.  Usually applications need to
	know both the namespace prefix <em>and</em> the namespace URI.  We
	currently follow the xmls <em>implementation</em> and use the
	namespace prefix instead of following its <em>documentation</em> which
	shows the URI.  We do not follow xmls in munging xmlns attribute
	values.  Attributes themselves have namespaces and it is not clear
	to me how that works in xmls.

      <div class="def">Function CXML-XMLS:MAKE-XMLS-BUILDER (&amp;key include-default-values include-namespace-uri)</div>
      Create a SAX handler which builds XMLS list structures.&#160;
      If <tt>include-default-values</tt> is true, default values for
      attributes declared in a DTD are included as attributes in the
      xmls output.  <tt>include-default-values</tt> is true by default
      and can be set to <tt>nil</tt> to suppress inclusion of default
      values.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <tt>include-namespace-uri</tt> is true (the default), node
      names and attribute names are pairs of local name and namespace
      URI. (Except for attributes without a namespace, which are named
      using a string.) Otherwise, nodes and attributes are named by
      their qualified name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre>(cxml:parse-file "test.xml" (cxml-xmls:make-xmls-builder))</pre>
    <p>
      <div class="def">Function CXML-XMLS:MAP-NODE (handler node &amp;key include-xmlns-attributes include-namespace-uri)</div>
      Traverse an XMLS document/node and call SAX functions as if an XML
      representation of the document were processed by a SAX parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use this function to serialize XMLS data.  For example, we could
      define a replacement for <tt>xmls:write-xml</tt> like this:
    </p>
    <pre>(defun write-xml (stream node &amp;key indent)
  (let ((sink (cxml:make-character-stream-sink
               stream :canonical nil :indentation indent)))
    (cxml-xmls:map-node sink node)))</pre>
    <p>
      <div class="def">Function CXML-XMLS:MAKE-NODE (&amp;key name ns attrs
      children) => xmls node</div>
      Build a list node of the form
      (<em>name</em>&#160;((<em>name</em>&#160;<em>value</em>)<em>*</em>)&#160;<em>child*</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The node list's <tt>car</tt> can also be a cons of local <tt>name</tt>
      and namespace prefix <tt>ns</tt>.
    </p>

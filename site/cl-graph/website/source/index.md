### What it is

CL-Graph is a Common Lisp library for manipulating graphs and
running graph algorithms. [TINAA][8] documentation for
CL-Graph is [available][9].

### Mailing Lists

  * [cl-graph-devel][devel-list]: A list for questions,
    patches, bug reports, and so on; It's for everything.

{anchor downloads}

### Where is it

A [darcs][] repository is available (note that you'll also
need to get several other bits and pieces to get CL-Graph to
work). The commands are listed below:

    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-graph/
    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/metabang-bind/
    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/metatilities-base/
    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/moptilities/

CL-Graph (and friends) should also be [ASDF
installable][asdf-install]. Its CLiki home is right
[where][cliki-home] you'd expect.

There's also a handy [gzipped tar file][tarball].

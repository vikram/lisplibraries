CL-MUPROC TODO

MAJOR STUFF

* Portability: Support other CL implementations than Lispworks.

* Scalability: Distributed operation.

* Reference manual - for muproc, generic-server, and supervisor.

* User manual/tutorial explaining muproc and introducing core
  idioms.

* Generic server: It is not clear that the way to define generic
  servers is 'just right'.

* State machine generic behaviour.

* Performance: Optimizing mumsg-receive could be worthwhile.

MINOR STUFF

* Add control over muproc input buffer size.

* Consider removing the requirement of unique names of muproc (what
  does it really contribute?).

* supervisor.lisp: Weed out some dbgformat forms.

* supervisor.lisp (*dying-period*): Make user configurable.

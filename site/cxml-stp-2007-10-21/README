   cxml-stp

   A data structure for well-formed XML documents, inspired by XOM but
   designed for Common Lisp.

   cxml-stp is an alternative to the W3C's DOM, which cxml also
   implements. It was written by David Lichteblau as an add-on library
   for Closure XML and is available under an X11-style license.

Chronicity
----------

A natural language date/time parser for Common Lisp.
by Chaitanya Gupta (mail@chaitanyagupta.com)

Inspired by (and copied verbatim from) from Chronic, the natural
language date/time parser for Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner.

Download and Installation
-------------------------

Chronicity depends on the following libraries:
  * cl-ppcre [http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre]
  * cl-interpol [http://weitz.de/cl-interpol]
  * local-time [http://common-lisp.net/project/local-time/]
    Works with the latest release version of local-time (1.0.3) and
    the dev version, but will break with older versions.

Get Chronicity from github:
  git clone git://github.com/chaitanyagupta/chronicity.git

Use ASDF to load:
  (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :chronicity)

Use ASDF:TEST-OP for tests:
  (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op :chronicity)

Source code for chronicity-test includes lisp-unit
(lisp-unit.lisp). This might be cause problems (or surprises) if your
image already uses a different version of lisp-unit.

Usage
-----

Use CHRONICITY:PARSE to parse date/time strings.

If *NOW* is not set, "now" is assumed to be this instant. All relative
date/time calculations are made with respect to "now".

  (setf chronicity:*now* (chronicity:make-datetime 2009 3 27 12 34 56))
  => @2009-03-27T12:34:56.000000+05:30
  
  (chronicity:parse "today")
  => @2009-03-27T13:00:00.000000+05:30
  
  (chronicity:parse "tomorrow" :now (chronicity:make-date 2009 1 1))
  => @2009-01-02T00:00:00.000000+05:30
  
  (chronicity:parse "3 days from now")
  => @2009-03-30T12:34:56.000000+05:30
  
  (chronicity:parse "next month")
  => @2009-04-01T00:00:00.000000+05:30

:ENDIAN-PREFERENCE indicates which date format to prefer in case of
ambiguity over days and months. :LITTLE indicates the format
"dd/mm/yyyy", :MIDDLE indicates "mm/dd/yyy". Default is :LITTLE.

  (chronicity:parse "1/2/2003")
  => @2003-02-01T00:00:00.000000+05:30

  (chronicity:parse "1/2/2003" :endian-preference :middle)
  => @2003-01-02T00:00:00.000000+05:30
  
Default value for :CONTEXT is :FUTURE.
  
  (chronicity:parse "April 1st at 12:30 PM")
  => @2009-04-01T12:30:00.000000+05:30

  (chronicity:parse "April 1st at 12:30 PM" :context :past)
  => @2008-04-01T12:30:00.000000+05:30
  
Default for :GUESS is :START.

  (chronicity:parse "next month" :guess :middle)
  => @2009-04-16T00:00:00.000000+05:30

CHRONICITY:PARSE usually returns a DATETIME object. Its attributes can
be accessed using the datetime readers.

  (chronicity:parse "next month" :guess :end)
  => @2009-04-30T23:59:59.000000+05:30

  (values (chronicity:year-of *)
          (chronicity:month-of *)
          (chronicity:day-of *)
          (chronicity:hour-of *)
          (chronicity:minute-of *)
          (chronicity:sec-of *))
  => 2009, 4, 30, 23, 59, 59

Passing NIL as the value for :GUESS returns a SPAN, which is a range
of datetime values.
  
  (chronicity:parse "next month" :guess nil)
  => #<CHRONICITY::SPAN 2009-04-01T00:00:00.000000+05:30...2009-05-01T00:00:00.000000+05:30>
  
  (values (chronicity:span-start *)
          (chronicity:span-end *)
          (chronicity:span-end-included-p *))
  => @2009-04-01T00:00:00.000000+05:30,
     @2009-05-01T00:00:00.000000+05:30,
     NIL

Limitations
-----------

Unlike Chronic, Chronicity doesn't support timezones and seasons
yet. Support is planned for future releases.

Internally, LOCAL-TIME:TIMESTAMP objects are used to represent
time. Any limitation which applies to these objects applies to
CHRONICITY:DATETIME objects as well.

Another problem is that parsing ordinals as words is supported except
for 'second', which is ambiguous with 'second', the unit of time. This
should be fixed in a future release.

[Added MCL compatibility; fixed some unportable EOL issues.
chandler**20041010133159
 Added MCL compatibility; fixed some unportable EOL issues.
 Renamed reverse-proxy-listener-class.lisp to reverse-proxy-listener.lisp to deal with MacOS filename limit of 32 characters.

[Do appropriate stuff for a Unicode build: pass :external-format :iso-8859-1 to open, so that arbitrary octets can pass through without encoding errors. This is probably not the right thing, but it makes things work.

[araneida-repl-create
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050616225541
 Create the araneida-repl directory, and include the first functions that
 are designed to be used from the repl to get information about araneida.
 
 I suppose that these could be useful outside of the repl, but I didn't think
 cluttering up araneida proper was such a great idea.

[Include the request-url for errors
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050617000849
 404 errors were difficult to track down, as they only showed up as "404". So I
 altered error reporting to include the URL requested.

[Eliminate implicit generic style warnings by adding generics - also includes some extra documentation
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050617001756
 Moved docstrings from methods to generics, added necessary generics, etc, etc, etc. Documentation
 should exist for all the generics I added...though maybe not.

[Basic "does-it-compile" testing, with error counting.
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050628211918
 Add the ability to check and make sure that the araneida system
 in the current directory does - in fact - compile.
 
 A report is generated at the end with a count of errors.
 The script will error out with 1 if any serious conditions are encountered
 while compiling.

[locale-independent urlstring-escape
frederic.gobry@epfl.ch**20050705062333
 
 At least with sbcl-0.9.2 w/ unicode support, working in an utf-8 environment causes the
 behavior of alphanumericalp to change, and return t for more characters than the us-ascii
 version. This patch explicitely lists the characters that can be made part of an URL without
 escaping.

[Temporarily eliminate all references to muffle-warning
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050705205712
 For some reason, muffle-warning is not available. I'll have to come back through
 and make it available. In the meantime, make things work.

[+allowed-url-symbols+ as parameter, not constant
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050705210901
 reference http://www.sbcl.org/manual/Defining-Constants.html#Defining%20Constants
 defconstant ran into trouble on compile/load, due to the issues described in the above document
 (basically being compiled then loaded produces an undefined situation for constants. Joy, no?).
 
 This could be solved either by a macro to only define the constant once, or by making the constant
 a parameter. I went with the latter option.
] 
[Add documentation string for +allowed-url-symbols+

[Fix muffle-warning error in test.lisp, re-enable muffled warnings
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050705220230
 Turns out that muffle-warning is a restart that I needed to add. I added it.
 Cleans up output beautifully, though SBCL shows that 2 important errors are caught.
 I think those are the "cannot optimize" errors that used to show up.
] 
[test.lisp "works" on SBCL
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050705230049
 Implements my-quit, to abstract away quitting - only works for SBCL right now.
 Get rid of the debugger, just quit instead.
 Block some SBCL-specific warnings, get muffle warning working, and that yields
 a working test!

[Initial creation of rfc2109.lisp
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050802233948
 Basic functionality works - you can create RFC compliant cookies.

[Turn off testing
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050808204414
 Okay, run test.sh by hand if you care. It was just getting annoying to
 work with. I'll run it by hand before I commit, but other people don't
 have SBCL.
] 
[Include the license text and some bookmark-like strings
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050803202346
 Marco suggested that I include the license text in its entirety.
 Also included some text strings that are easy to find so as to get
 to the most externally-relevant code.

[Fix token? and quoted-string? to account for empty and non-empty strings
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050803212954
 The specification for tokens says that they must be at least one character.
 Fixed.
 
 The specification for quoted strings says that the empty quoted string is
 acceptible. Fixed. So we can now have "" values.

[Parse cookies
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050803235648
 We now parse RFC2109 cookies. We don't parse old Netscape cookies just yet.

[Quiet the compiler about *ht* *cr* and *lf*
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050804002844
 SBCL was whining about vars being used before they're declared. Sensible, I suppose.
 Moved and made a note.

[Fix QUOTED-STRING? to take into account escaped quotes
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050804214959
 You know, I wrote a function to remove escaped quotes from a string...
 amazing that I didn't use it. Now I do.
 
 Also, I tucked the helper function for removing escaped quotes into
 the function that uses it. Much cleaner that way.

[No longer demand domains of the style ".blah.blah"
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050804215246
 Turns out that the RFC allows (in fact desires) domains of the style "blah.blah",
 so those are now legal.
] 
[parse-cookie-string needs to allow quoted strings inside it
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050804215336
 Wrote a small tokenizer that splits - taking into account quoted strings.
 We're really getting to the point that a pattern language would be useful.
 
 Anyways, it works well, now.

[Implement domain-match-p
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050804215558
 While debugging an issue with w3m and cookies (which hasn't gone away, btw),
 I needed to check my knowledge of a "domain-match" - I've included the function
 in case others find it useful.

[araneida: swap THREAD-ALIVE-P for UNIX-KILL
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050810225617
 On the advice of Friedrich Dominicus <frido@q-software-solutions.de>,
 swapping thread-alive-p for unix-kill makes things work on Debian for AMD64.
 
 Seems to work for me as well - by which I mean it compiles.

[rfc2109: redefine valid domain based on a re-reading of 4.3.2
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050810200905
 w3m and the Mozilla bugs set me straight on the reading of 4.3.2.
 This patch requires an explicitly defined domain for domain, meaning
 it must be:
 a value
 start with a "."
 and contain an embedded "."

[rfc2109: Update safe-parse-cookies using new understanding of domain cookies
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050810221808
 After sorting out what the issue was with explicit domains, update safe-parse-cookies
 (mostly documentation) to reflect this knowledge.

[rfc2109: add a note about Moz and IE's lack of RFC compliance
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050810222004
 Mozilla, Links, and IE all have a problem with quoted PATHs. As quoted paths
 are demanded by the RFC, there's really no way around this. Luckily, Moz
 has this fixed in latest alpha. Note added to docs as well as workaround suggestion.
 
 Bug reference:
 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=277033
 
 There is the option of adding a bonus-points-compatible-cookie-string option for
 outputing compatible code, but I would really rather not go down that road.
 Output strict, accept loose.

[Optional condition to signal when cookie not found
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050819185215
 In some code it's easier to assume the cookie is found and have a
 signal handler for when it's not. This adds a parameter to the cookie
 fetching routines that enables the signaling of said condition.
 
 Share and enjoy.

[rfc2109: Add basic testing and a tester

 Decided to add a basic testing framework - mostly because I'm mucking about
 with parsing and another library, want something to let me know when I've
 REALLY screwed up.
 
 Please note that the current stable version of FiveAM will not run these tests,
 as it doesn't have the *features* that are needed to define them. I've submitted
 a patch to Marco, we'll see if he adds it.

[Update safe-parse-cookie to properly nconc instead of append - thanks Richard!
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050825193902

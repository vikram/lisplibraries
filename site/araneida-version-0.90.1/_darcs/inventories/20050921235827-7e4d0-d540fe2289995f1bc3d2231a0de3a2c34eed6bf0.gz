[Put the main source in its own component for dependency reasons
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050915225000
 A few of the files were requiring "compat" and almost all of the files required "defpackage",
 so I tucked the main source in its own module - the :pathname "" makes it still look in the
 root directory.
 
 This should simplify the ASDF file a bit.
 
 In retrospect, this is a semi-pointless change, but one that I sank the time into doing while
 I was chasing a semi-bug...why not record it?

[Ignore some extraneous variables so as to stop some warnings

[Removed unused macro "maybe-output"
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050915230517
 We don't use it any more, and it didn't seem to be working anymore, besides.
 I left the name in the patch subject, though, which should make it easy
 to undo if/when we need it again.

[Lambda passed where there shouldn't have been one
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050915230654
 the macro that wraps this call automagically wraps it
 in a lambda - so we don't need this one any more.

[Memoize takes functions, not (or function symbol)
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050915231848
 This speeds up memoize a bit and removes an annoying compiler note.
 Yeah, I'm tweaked like that.

[araneida: create the obsolete directory
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050920193150
 The obsolete directory is for code that I plan to remove, but
 should stay in for at least one release. For some of the independent code,
 such as dhttp.lisp, this has the added benefit that people will have to update
 their code and be aware that they are using depricated code.

[araneida: move dhttp to obsolete/
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050920193348
 Does anyone USE dhttp anymore?

[rfc2109: allow nil to be passed to safe-parse-cookies
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050920212250
 The docs say that you can pass nil to safe-parse-cookies to have no
 legal domains to allow cookies to come from (ie they must come from your
 server or not at all).
 Whoops.

[araneida: request-send-error modified to show client error message
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050921192602
 The condition system stipulates a :CLIENT-MESSAGE that will be sent
 to the user. The current request-send-error doesn't receive that.
 
 I rewrote it to where it does - note that any direct callers of
 request-send-error must be modified to take this into account.
 
 The signature change should clue people in to this. I hope.

[araneida: export SEND-FILE
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050921192856
 Many people don't want to use the static-file-handler but do
 want to be able to send files. This lets you do that now.

Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050921210329
 I don't know how many people use this function, but it seemed best
 to have it work.
 
 It works now.

[araneida: big patch to get test server working even better
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050921225124
 Test server now produces random text which the test client looks for.
 Works with threaded and non-threaded SBCL, and should be pretty
 easily extended to other servers.
 As a test, I'm going to try out CMUCL next.

[araneida: test suite correction - look before leaping error
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050921232717
 Turns out that we need to set *quit* BEFORE we stop listening,
 as stop-listening breaks us out of the function in some lisps (SBCL).

[araneida: add CMUCL to test suite
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050921232809
 This patch is a good example of what you have to do to
 add a new lisp to the test suite. It's small, thankfully.
 
 Enjoy!

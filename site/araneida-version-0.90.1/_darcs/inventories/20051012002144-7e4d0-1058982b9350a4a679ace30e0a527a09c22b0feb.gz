[araneida: append-url
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050924002149
 It makes sense if you think about the name of the function, but the first time merge-url
 pulls this action on you, you get a little...irate:
 (merge-url (merge-url (parse-url "http://example.com/") "/foo") "/bar")
 becomes
 <URL "http://example.com/bar">
 
 Nevermind that this is exactly what you want sometimes.
 
 So, I've created append-url, that would, given the same sequence as above, become:
 <URL "http://example.com/foo/bar">
 
 It's a little rough right now, but it should work. I'll clarify the docs for merge-url
 Real Soon Now.

[araneida: attach-hierarchy added
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050924002519
 I'm the type that likes declarative sentences. Just like that last one.
 I find that I like declaring the hierarchy and handlers of my web app
 in one place as a sort of table of contents for the app.
 
 So, I thought to myself: self, why don't you make that executable?
 
 And so it was.
 
 ...please help me with the documentation. I'm certain it's horrid.

[araneida: html docs for some utilities

[araneida: sleep longer, know cmucl
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050928234555
 On a fresh compile it can take longer than 5 seconds before the server is ready.
 10 seconds seems to do the trick most of the time - I might consider putting in
 a sleep loop in the client script, though.
 
 CMUCL was added to the test suite last time, but not to the help docs. Whoops.

[araneida: (setf don't-be-stupid t)
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050928234811
 Turns out I DO know how to do quotes-within-quotes, but SLIME was showing me the string
 representation, so of COURSE there were escaped quotes. Argh. Right.

[araneida: handle proxy stuff with attach-hierarchy
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050928234916
 You know, almost all of my stuff is proxy'd, why didn't I take this into account
 while finishing up the macro? Right. Anyways.
 ATTACH-HIERARCHY requires two url parameters, now: internal and external. Internal
 is used for attaching, external is used for (-url) functions.
 If you're not using a reverse-proxy or any sort of translation, you'll be fine
 by just giving the URL twice.

[araneida: with-url-params, with-tainted-url-params
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20050930191820
 Common pattern of use is grabbing url parameters
 and doing something with them. with- makes sense here.
 It is so.

[taint: add tainted-p
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20051002005436
 Surprisingly enough, it sometimes comes in handy to be able to tell
 when a value is tainted. Crazy stuff.

[araneida: defurlmethod
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20051002013953
 I'm a bit nuts, I know, but I've always wanted to treat url parameters
 and body parameters as dispatchable function parameters.
 
 ...now you can.
 More documentation forthcoming.

[araneida: defurlmethod parameter order issue
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20051004190942
 I forgot that set-difference doesn't guarantee the order of the result set,
 so I have to remove-if instead.
 
 Test added.

[araneida: update bookmarks for tests
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20051004191238
 I noticed that I hadn't put down the right URLs in the comment bookmarks. Whoops. Fixed.

[araneida: better error when html element attribute is not a symbol
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20051004202357
 I got tired of receiving '"Internal ID" is not a symbol' in the middle
 of a huge block of code, not having any clue what was going on.
 
 Now it will spit out a more specific error along with the parameters passed.

[araneida: brain error on parameter order test

 ...I was NOT actually testing parameter order. I forgot to take

[araneida: handle end-of-file while reading from socket with listener
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20051005231755
 It's a pretty unremarkable thing for the client to disconnect in the middle
 of a request. This patch causes the server to skip on to abort response
 when it encounters this condition.

[araneida: wrap evals in test suite with mutex
Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20051005233750
 SBCL doesn't seem to like concurrent calls to eval - maybe it's a problem
 with my macro expansion and threads, I don't know. What I DO know is that
 wrapping the eval calls in a mutex causes the problem to go away.
 
 So guess what I'm doing.

Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu**20051006003259
 A question was raised on LispWeb about how well Araneida would hold up to repeated

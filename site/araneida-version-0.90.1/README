Your first point of call for questions should be the lispweb mailing
list.  If you mail me (Daniel) directly you may not get a timely
response, and if you mail me to ask about non-SBCL stuff you won't get
a useful response either.  I tell you this now not because I'm
naturally offensive, but because I only use SBCL and I'm basically
just really badly organised.  For lispweb details, see

Araneida 0.90  - 1 Dec 2005
* First non-a
* Features:
  - Integration with Parenscript!
    If you have Marco Baringer's maintained version of Parenscript (darcs: http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/repos/parenscript)
	Araneida will load it and use it. HTML, HTML-STREAM, and HTML-ESCAPED-STREAM work with it.
	Please see the documentation in doc/html.html for more info on how to use it with Araneida.
  - DEFTEMPLATE, CALL-TEMPLATE - a nice set of convenience functions for prettily separating out your template code.
    See the documentation in doc/html.html
  - DEFHTMLTAG - Araneida has long been able to define custom tags in HTML that do special things.
    This macro lets you easily access this functionality. Some sample code and instructions are in doc/html.html
  - LINK - (url :param-a value :param-b value) becomes: "http://url?param-a=value&param-b=value" with proper escaping
  - URL objects now princ as you'd expect. prin1 is the old behavior.
    (to clarify: (html '(span url)) will become: <span>http://url.goes.here</span> rather than the old behavior
	 which was to do <span>#<URL http://url.goes.here></span>)
  - HTML-ESCAPED-STREAM - properly HTML escapes content, otherwise the equivalent of HTML-STREAM.
  - URL-QUERY-STRING-FROM-ALIST - create a ?a=b&c=d... string from an alist. The opposite of URL-QUERY-ALIST
  - enhancements to HTML, HTML-STREAM, and HTML-ESCAPED-STREAM:
   	+ '(comment (span "yes")) becomes <!-- <span>yes</span> -->
  - URLSTRING-ESCAPE faster(?)
* Bugfixes:
  - too-many-url-methods-matched, if ever thrown, would itself cause an error. This has been fixed.
  - static-file-handler now properly url unescapes the file name
  - properly bind *trace-output* and friends when creating new threads to handle the changes in SBCL.
  - key values in parametermethods fixed
* Handle bivalent streams in SBCL properly(?). More work is necessary to do everything people want to do, but
  the basics are there.
* Patchless TBNL compatibility!
* Increased compatibility with Allegro Common Lisp (thank you Arthur Lemmens!)
* Backwards-incompatible changes:
  - HTML has a different function signature now. It should not functionally affect any code, as the old parameter was ignored.
    HTML now works like HTML-STREAM, where you pass the tags that cause newlines as a key parameter. Most code should
	not need to be changed - your compiler should notify you if yours does.

Araneida 0.9-a3 - 21 Sept 2005
* Last -a3 planned.
* Additional documentation
* Minor fixes to the test suite
* Some better error reporting with HTML generation
* Gracefully handle client disconnects (pronounced "drop it on the floor")
* tainted-p, the tainted predicate
* append-url, the younger, cruder cousin of merge-url. Used in attach-hierarchy
* attach-hierarchy - a way to declare the url structure of a website and
  how that matches up to the classes in the system. You'll want to read the docs
  in doc/utilities.html - even more docs in convenience.lisp.
* with-url-params and with-tainted-url-params, documented in doc/request_parameters.html
* defurlmethod and deftaintedurlmethod: multi-method-dispatch on url parameters.
  Documented in doc/request_parameters.html.
* Stress testing script for testing massive numbers of clients in araneida using siege.
  Script is benchmark.sh.

Araneida 0.9-a2
* .asd file simplified a bit
* Some cruft removed
* Compiles without style warnings in SBCL 0.9.4.65
* Moved dhttp.lisp to obsolete/ - will be deleting next release
  unless someone tells me they use it.
* Updated version of cookie library RFC2109
* error conditions now honor :client-message, as a result
  any direct calls of REQUEST-SEND-ERROR need to be updated!
* SEND-FILE now exported
* Test server and client for automated unit testing for SBCL and CMUCL
  currently tests major functionality of araneida.
  I hope to add detection for bugs as I find them.
  You will need perl and WWW::Mechanize to run the tests.
* Bugfixes

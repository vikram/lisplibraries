The utilities in this directory are (supposedly) useful for getting
information about and working with araneida from the REPL.

Such as taking an http-listener (often called *listener*) and having
a pretty summary of all the handlers below it.

ROC> (araneida-repl:show-listener-handlers *listener*)
http://localhost:1106/*         (ROC-VIEW)
	xml/*        (ROC-XML)
		userviewtable/*           (USERVIEW-TABLE-XMLET)
		usertable/*               (USER-TABLE-XMLET)
		userdetailpane/*          (USER-DETAIL-PANE-XMLET)
		user/*            (USER-XMLET)

Others may appear if people find such things useful.

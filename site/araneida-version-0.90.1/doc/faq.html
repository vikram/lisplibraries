<h2>Why?</h2>

<p> Because it seemed like fun.  Because CL-HTTP is not free in a DFSG
sense.  Because the startup time of the average Lisp envronment is
longer than is probably acceptable for writing CGI in the language
(and CGI is <i>awful</i> anyway, let's face it).

<p>Mostly because it seemed like fun.

<h2>Where did you get the name?</h2>

<p>A dictionary.

<hr>

<p> Other answers will be forthcoming if anybody asks the questions

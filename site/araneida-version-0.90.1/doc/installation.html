<title>Araneida Reference : Installation</title>
</head><body>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Araneida is distributed as an <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/ASDF+System" >ASDF System</a>.  If you have
a properly installed recent (0.8) SBCL, and you're on the Internet, do
<pre>
* (require 'asdf)
* (require 'asdf-install)
* (asdf-install:install :araneida)
</pre>

to download, install, compile and load.  Once compiled, you can reload
Araneida in future sessions with just <tt>(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op
'araneida)</tt>.  Now skip forward to the Use section

<p>If your target system is not sufficiently on the Internet for this to
work, you may have to do a little more manual work:

<ol>
<li>You need an SBCL that has <a
href="http://ww.telent.net/cliki/asdf" >asdf</a> loaded into it</a>.
In SBCL 0.8 or later, asdf is bundled and you should just be able to
type <tt>(require 'asdf)</tt> to ensure this is the case.

<li>From your favourite <a
href="http://ww.telent.net/cclan-choose-mirror" >cCLan mirror</a>,
download <tt>net-telent-date</tt>, <tt>split-sequence</tt> and
<tt>araneida</tt>, and untar them somewhere (for simplicity, have them
share a common parent directory)

<li> Create symlinks to the unpacked .asd files in a directory on your
asdf <tt>*central-registry*</tt> list.  For example

<pre>
* asdf::*central-registry*
(*DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* "/home/dan/src/defsystems/")

$ cd /home/dan/src/defsystems/
$ ln -s ../telent/araneida/araneida.asd ../telent/net-telent-date/net-telent-date.asd ../telent/db-sockets/db-sockets.asd .
</pre>

<li> You should now be able to compile and load the systems with 
<pre>
* (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'araneida)
</pre>

<li> If that gave you error messages, another system dependency was
probably added since these instructions were last updated.  Grab the
extra package from cclan and add it in much the same way, then report
this bug in the documentation.

<li> Congratulations.  It's now working. 

</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2><a name="use">Use </a></h2>

<p>Oh, you wanted to be able to actually use it?  Load Araneida with
<pre>
(require 'asdf)
(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'araneida)
</pre>

then compile and load <a href="example.lisp">doc/example.lisp</a> in
the source distribution.  For more information, study that file
carefully and read the rest of this <a href="reference.html" >documentation</a>.
</pre>

<p> Point your browser at http://your.host.name:8000/ to test

<p>If you want to use Araneida mod_proxy (generally recommended), you
have to configure that too.  Configuring Apache is Outside The Scope
of these instructions, but as a start, here are the relevant lines
from my Debian laptop:
<pre>
LoadModule proxy_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/libproxy.so
NameVirtualHost noetboot.telent.net
Include /etc/apache.conf.include
</pre>
<p>For more information on using a reverse proxy in front of Araneida,
see the <a href="listeners.html">Listeners</a> documentation.

<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2> Handler debugging</h2>

<p>The special variable *RESTART-ON-HANDLER-ERRORS* governs whether
errors signalled during handler execution should drop you into the
debugger or not.  
<ul>
<li> If it's T (the default), you just get a backtrace on
*TRACE-OUTPUT* and processing continues as normal.  Obviously this is
recommended for production sites.  
<li> Setting it to NIL drops you into the debugger.
<li> If it's a function designator, we call that function with the
condition that was signalled, and it is expected to handle the error
or return T or NIL (which will be treated as above)
</ul>

<p>This can be used as a hook for alternative debugger interfaces: for
example, SLIME users may run
<pre>
(setf *restart-on-handler-errors* (swank:slime-debugger-function))
</pre>
from their *slime-repl* to make Araneida handler errors invoke the
emacs-based interactive debugger.

<p>Note that this variable has the opposite sense of the (badly-named)
*BREAK-ON-HANDLER-ERRORS* flag in older versions.  That variable still
exists (and works) but is deprecated and may be removed in future.

<p>The THREADED-HTTP-LISTENER also has a timeout for responses: any
thread spending more than *HANDLER-TIMEOUT* seconds in a response will
be automatically timed out and made to select the ABORT-RESPONSE
restart so that it can answer another request.  The default timeout is
60, which is probably too short in all situations that it is not too long.

<h2> Threads</h2>

<p>The thread support has not been hammered on very hard, and 
depends on SBCL threads which have not themselves been tested
particularly hard.  If you run into weird threading bugs, (a) I'd like to
know about anything you can reproduce, (b) the serve-event support is
probably more stable.

<p> If you're using threads with SBCL, it gets easier if you're also
using sb-aclrepl <tt>(require 'sb-aclrepl)</tt>.  If you get a 
"debugger invoked" message followed by "Thread <i>n</i> suspended", 
you can use the <tt>:focus</tt> command to switch that thread to the
foreground.  When you exit the debugger by selecting any restart, 
the thread will background before continuing.

<p>Note that a thread in the debugger will eventually be reset by the
timeout mechanism (see above).

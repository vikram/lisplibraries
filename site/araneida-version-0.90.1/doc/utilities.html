<h1>REPL Utilities</h1>
<p>While you're working with an Araneida system, sometimes you find yourself
wondering "what handlers do I have, and where are they attached?". Well, I find
myself wondering that on a regular basis.

<p>So I wrote SHOW-HANDLER-HIERARCHY and SHOW-LISTENER-HANDLERS.

<p>Given a handler, SHOW-HANDLER-HIERARCHY will print out what handlers are below it.
If a handler is an inexact matcher, an asterisk will be appended to the end of its name.

<p>Given a listener, SHOW-LISTENER-HANDLERS will do the same as above.


<pre>
(show-listener-handlers *listener*)
</pre>


<h1>Programming Utilities</h1>
<p>If you wish to declaratively define the handlers for URLs in Araneida (and you don't mind
them all being inexact matchers), ATTACH-HIERARCHY is the macro for you.

<p>The documentation is contained in convenience.lisp. It's quite easy, once you get used to it.

<p>here is a small example, though:

<pre>
(attach-hierarchy (http-listener-handler *listener*) (parse-urlstring "http://example.com/")
    ("/puppies-and-kittens" puppy-and-kitten-handler)
    ("/lizards-and-fish" lizard-and-fish-simulator)
    ("/orderform" order-form-dispatching-handler
                  ("/order-a-whole-bunch-of-croppy" das-megacroppy-handler)
		  ("/order-a-cute-kitten" kitten-feed-handler)))
</pre>

<p>Documentation is through the docstring, so you can also view it via:
<pre>
(documentation 'araneida:attach-hierarchy 'function)
</pre>

<h1>Servers</h1>

<p> Araneida understands the HTTP/1.1 Host header, to support multiple
`virtual servers' in the same instance.  Before you can export any
handlers, you need to decide the hostnames that you plan to serve
content from, and register them with Araneida

<pre>
# Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you 
# define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't understand
# this, ask your network administrator.

<i>Function</i> <B>EXPORT-SERVER</b>

<p><b>Syntax:</b>

<p><b>export-server</b> <i>server</i>

<p><b>Arguments and Values:</b>

<p><i>server</i> - a SERVER object.  See <a
href="../server-class.lisp">server-class.lisp</a> for details

<p><b>Description:</b>

<p>Registers <i>server</i> with Araneida, so that we know how to
answer requests for it.  The same registration list is also used for
<b>output-apache-conf</b>

<p>Note that the name and port in the server's BASE-URL slot don't
have to be the same as in PORT and NAME.  NAME and PORT give the
address that Araneida will start a server on, whereas BASE-URL is the
server's <i>published</i> address.  If you're using a forwarding proxy
(recommended for production sites), you should configure the proxy
to answer for BASE-URL and forward requests onto Araneida on HOST:PORT

<p> You can see this in <a href="../examples/main.lisp"
>../examples/main.lisp</a> which works with Apache on port 80 and
Araneida on port 8000

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<ol>
<li> Araneida cannot configure network interfaces, nor will it
administer your DNS for you.  Before getting too involved in a virtual
host configuration that's not working, check that the hostname(s)
you're planning to use are set up and pointing to the right machine.

<li> Even if you plan to use Araneida with an Apache proxy in front of
it, it may help to set Araneida up on its own first to check that your  
handlers etc work

</ol>

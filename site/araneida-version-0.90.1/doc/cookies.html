<h1>Cookies</h1>
<p>To store data client-side, put it in a cookie. Cookies have a name
and a value. There are some restrictions on what the name can be: stick
with just alphabet characters and you'll be okay.

<p>First, you have to send the cookie to the client:

<pre>
(defmethod handle-request-response ((handler intro-handler) method request)
  (request-send-headers request :set-cookie (cookie-string "cookiename" "cookievalue"))
  (html-stream
   (request-stream request)
   `(html (body
           (p "Cookie set.")))))
</pre>

<p>Afterwards, this cookie value will be available via a call to REQUEST-COOKIE.

<pre>
(defmethod handle-request-response ((handler show-cookie) method request)
  (request-send-headers request)
  (html-stream
   (request-stream request)
   `(html (body
	   (p "The cookie value is: " ,(request-cookie request "cookiename"))))))
</pre>

<p>To set a new value for the cookie, re-send the cookie as above.

<p>There are more parameters to cookie-string than shown here, they are all keyword
parameters. To have the above be a session cookie (deleted when the browser is closed):

<pre>
(cookie-string "cookiename" "cookievalue" :max-age 0)
</pre>

<p>To see the full parameter list:
<pre>
(documentation 'cookie1:cookie-string 'function)
</pre>

<h1>Prevent Cookie Spoofing</h1>
<p>It is possible for another website to send your site a cookie without you being aware of it.
If dan.example.com set a cookie like so:

<pre>
(cookie-string "bad" "cookie" :domain ".example.com")
</pre>

<p>and your website was ann.example.com, you would receive that cookie.

<p>If your web app does not use domain cookies, it's best to ignore them - which would ignore the
above cookie.

<pre>
(request-safe-cookie request "my" nil)
</pre>

<p>If you do use domain cookies, it's best to specify the domains you will accept explicitly.
<pre>
(request-safe-cookie request "my" ".example.com")
</pre>

<p>This will not stop all instances, but it's a good start.


<h1>When the cookie isn't found</h1>
<p>When you request a specific cookie, there is the possibility that it won't be found.
Sometimes it's easier to assume the cookie is found, and set up a signal handler for when
it isn't.

<p>The REQUEST-COOKIE and REQUEST-SAFE-COOKIE methods take a keyword parameter that
can enable signaling an error.

<pre>
(handler-case
    (request-cookie request "mycookie" :on-fail :signal-condition)
  (cookie-not-found (condition) (format *trace-output* "Cookie not found! ~A" condition)))
</pre>

<p>By default the methods return nil.

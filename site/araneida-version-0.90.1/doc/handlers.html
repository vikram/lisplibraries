<h1>Handlers</h1>

<p>A handler is a CLOS object responsible for handling requests to a
given portion of the URL space.  Typically, you create a subclass of
HANDLER, and specialise methods on one or more of the generic
functions listed in handler.lisp.  HANDLE-REQUEST-RESPONSE is a good
place to start.  A response handler should return non-NIL, otherwise
Araneida will send a 404

<p>A dispatching handler calls authentication and authorization methods,
then dispatches on the sub-handler, then logs.

<p>The HTTP methods is a specialisable argument - it's not unusual to
do different things for GET and POST at the same url.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>An <a href="listeners.html">http-listener</a> points at a
dispatching-handler (which is usually created along with the listener);
typically you install your handlers as child handlers of that root.

For example,

<pre>
(install-handler (http-listener-handler *my-listener*)
    (make-instance 'static-file-handler :pathname #p"/tmp/fooo")  
    "http://ww.noetbook.telent.net/tmp/logo" nil)
</pre>
installs a STATIC-FILE-HANDLER to answer requests starting with
<tt>http://ww.noetbook.telent.net/tmp/logo</tt>

<p>The first argument to INSTALL-HANDLER is the parent handler: if you
create your handler based on DISPATCHING-HANDLER (as distinct from the
plain HANDLER) it can have subhandlers installed in it this way.
CLiki is a real-world example of this technique.

<h2>Handler invocation</h2>

<p>When a request comes in, the http-listener's root handler's
handle-request method is invoked on it.  This is usually a
dispatching-handler, so calls whichever appropriate subhandler you've
installed for the URL.  If you install more dispatching-handlers, the
dispatch will happen again.

<p>At each level of dispatch, another clause is pushed onto the request's
HANDLED-BY slot value.  This is a list of lists

<pre>
((handler index)
 (handler index)
 ...)
</pre>

where index is the element after the last position in the urlstring
that was used for discrimination.  You can get at the unmatched part
of the URL string using REQUEST-UNHANDLED-PART.

<h2>Producing output</h2>

<p>
Usually the HANDLE-REQUEST-RESPONSE stage is the one that gets to send
back a response.  However, any earlier stage can send one if it wants
(usually in an atypical situation, like "you have supplied an
incorrect password").  If it does this, it should signal
RESPONSE-SENT, so that the later methods are not invoked.

<p>An HTTP response consists of a header and a body, and it's strongly
recommended that you write the header using REQUEST-SEND-HEADERS.
It returns the response code.

REQUEST-SEND-HEADERS copes automatically with HTTP/0.9 requests and
will also help you with conditional GETs if you ask it to: if you
supply :conditional t and :last-modified some-universal-time, it will
check for an If-Modified-Since header in the request, and send a 304
if the response has been sent already.  If it sends a 304, it will then
signal RESPONSE-SENT instead of returning, so if you wish to do 
any further processing after sending the request be sure to wrap it in
UNWIND-PROTECT.  See the documentation on <a href="caching.html">HTTP
caching</a> for more detail.


<h2>Errors</h2>

<p>HTTP errors (e.g. 404, 500) can be signalled with SIGNAL; see the
<a href="example.lisp">example</a>.  For a list of condition names,
see <a href="../http-errors.lisp">http-errors.lisp</a>.

<h2>Authentication and authorization methods</h2>

<p>
Identities (usernames, basically) are unique per realm

<p>
Typically, we arrange that the authentication method is responsible
for checking that the supplied credentials are correct for the given
identity in the given URL space.  It will only produce a page if the
credentials were not supplied or don't match the claimed identity (and
might not necessarily even then)

<p>
The authorization method has to check if the requested action is allowed
to the given identity when connecting from the given host name (though
note that IP-based authorization is not implemented currently - no
point as the proxy loses all the relevant information for us)

<p>
For example

<p>
0) To use the HTTP authentication methods, make sure that your URL
space corresponds to an HTTP realm.  You need an authentication
handler that digs for the request header's Authorization: line and
shoves a suitable user identifier into (request-user ) or hands out
the appopriate 40x error.  A null authorization handler will produce
a behaviour like the apache "require valid-user" directive, or you
could actually write a handler that checked this to confine it
further.

<p>
How your application reports "incorrect password" (not authenticated)
as distinct from "we believe it's you, but you can't do that" (not
authorized) is up to you.  Most browsers' user interface to this stuff
makes it hard to distinguish the two cases anyway; you might find it's 
simplest just to put everything in the authentication handler if the
users aren't going to notice the difference.

<p>
1) cookie-based authentication, where the user's browser supplies a
cookie that we previously sent him.  Our authentication handler
checks the supplied cookie against our internal records, filling in
the (request-user ) slot if it matches.  Our authorization handler
checks if (request-user ) is one of the users allowed here, and
prints a helpful error page if not. 

<p>
2) ident-based authentication - you don't want to use this for
anything serious but in a secure intranet environment it might be
appropriate.  Suggested implementation route would involve getting
apache to do the actual lookup as (a) it won't block, and (b) you'll
only end up identing the apache daemon if you do it yourself anyway.

<p>
Note 

<p>
1) that we don't care what you put in the request-user slot provided
that your authentication and authorization handlers both agree on
it.  It could be a string username, user id, CLOS object defining a user, or
whatever.

<p>
2) When IP-based access control becomes possible, it could conceivably
be used at authentication _or_ authorization stage.  We might decide
for example that all requests from pc10.foo.com are from John Smith
(authenticate the request as from "John Smith") or we might decide that
all administrator requests must come from localhost - authentication
is identifying the remote user whereas authorization is checking that
he's "administrator" and connected from localhost.  Clear?

source distribution for some slightly more complex examples.  To see

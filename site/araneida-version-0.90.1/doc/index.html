<h1>Araneida: a free CL web server</h1>

<p> Araneida is a small extensible CL-based web server, designed to
sit behind a proxying Apache but also capable of being run standalone.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li> SBCL.  Probably also works with CMUCL/db-sockets with only fairly minor tweaking
<li> SBCL contrib packages: asdf, sb-bsd-sockets
<li> Other <a href="http://ww.telent.net/cliki/ASDF+System">ASDF
packages</a> from cCLan: net-telent-date
</ul>

<h2>News</h2>

<p>See the <a href="../NEWS">NEWS</a> file

<h2>Features/non-features</h2>
<ul>
<li> Free - <a href="../LICENCE">BSD-sans-advertising</a> licence, but
for the modification that I'm not the Regents of the University of California
<li> Does not use multiple threads.  Hooks into the SBCL/CMUCL event loop so
for many purposes it behaves as though it does.
<li> Designed to sit behind a caching proxy; can write appropriate
bits of <a href="http://www.apache.org/httpd.html">Apache</a> config.
If this bothers you, pretend that <tt>mod_proxy</tt> is a typo for
<tt>mod_araneida</tt>.  This includes playing nicely with SSL
<li> Understands HTTP/1.1 Host: header for multiple host support
<li> All content is dynamic and created by calling user-defined
handler functions (there is a handler in there already that outputs
files, if you need it)
<li> Cheesy HTML-from-sexpr generation function makes balancing 
<tt>&lt;/td> </tt>
tags suddenly trivially simple (if tending to generate lots of
short-lived garbage)
</ul>

looking at now: the documentation is in need of some restructuring and
its URLs will change.

<p>Good luck!

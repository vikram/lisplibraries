<h1>Caching</h1>

<p>Proper use of HTTP caching can make your application run faster and
use less bandwidth - especially when using Apache mod_proxy - and is
also friendlier to the rest of the Internet.  Improper use of caching
can lead to stale pages or to visitors getting content intended for
other people.

<p>Araneida's REQUEST-SEND-HEADERS allows all HTTP response headers to
be sent, giving you full control over caching.  You are advised to
read RFC 2616 for the detail, but here are a few tips:

<ul>
<li> Set a Last-Modified time, if at all possible.  With a
correct :Last-Modified argument and :CONDITIONAL T to request-send-headers,
Araneida will send appropriate "304 Not modified" responses on your behalf.

<li> Caches use the Expires header to determine when a cached response
is stale (meaning that it should be revalidated with the origin
server), not necessarily when it should be flushed from the cache
altogether.  If mod_proxy receives a request for which is has a fresh
response, it will send that response without even consulting Araneida.
If it has a stale response it will query Araneida first, using a
conditional GET to which araneida may respond with a 304.  So even if
you can't predict the future well enough to set long expiry times, you
can still derive some benefit from caching at least in the case where
it is cheaper to determine whether a resource has changed than it is
to generate the resource afresh.

<li> If you don't set Expires, mod_proxy (and other caches) will
attempt to guess a suitable staleness time based on the Last-Modified
header.  In mod_proxy this is controlled using
CacheLastModifiedFactor.  I'd suggest that in a dynamic web
application it's probably easiest to set this to 0 so that the cache
defaults to revalidating every time, and send explicit Expires headers
when you know that a request won't always need this conservative
treatment (e.g. on static files).

<p>Note that you can specialise request-send-headers on your static
file handlers to implement your expiry policy.  For example

<pre>
(defclass cached-file-handler (static-file-handler) ())
(defmethod request-send-headers ((h cached-file-handler) &rest rest)
  (apply #'call-next-method :expires (+ (get-universal-time) 86400) rest))
</pre>

<li> If using mod_proxy, add "LogLevel debug" in the apache httpd.conf
and watch the error log.  It will tell you a lot about the caching
decisions that Apache is making: even more, if you read it with
reference to the Apache source code.  Note that as well as per-request
debugging this will also give you some more messages that indicate
actual errors (e.g. when apache doesn't have permission to write to
its cache directory)

<li> Restarting Apache will not clear its cache, but it appears to be
safe to wipe it out with <tt>rm</tt> whenever necessary.

</ul>

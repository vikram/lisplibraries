  "Determine if the (interactively entered) AST is complete, in that the next line in the input ~

  ;; This heuristic recognizes the following common function patterns:
  ;;
  ;;  1. def f():
  ;;       ...
  ;;       return 42  (`return' at the end of function body)
  ;;
  ;;  2. def f():

  ;; The heuristic fails if the user tries to define a generator in this way:
  ;;
  ;;  def f():
  ;;     return
  ;;     yield 1
  ;;
  ;; The `yield' makes it a generator. But the heuristic decides that the
  ;; top-level `return' signals the end of the function, so the user does
  ;; not get the possiblity to add the `yield' at the end.
  ;;
  ;; The user can however input an equivalent definition, by inserting the
  ;; `yield' somewhere before the return, like:
  ;; 
  ;;  def f():
  ;;    if 0: yield 1
  ;;    return

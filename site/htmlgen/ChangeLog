	* the html macro will now macroexpand forms it sees before
	  determining if they are markup for expressions to evaluate

2001-05-14  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* add a method for specifying that an entity argument name should
	  listed alone without being followed by an equal sign and value.
	  This is an incompatible change in the unlikely event that you
	  have code that gives the symbol || as an argument value and
	  you expect this to be printed as ="" by the html printer

	* htmlgen/htmlgen.cl - when printing option values inside
	  a tag, a symbol is now printed as the string
	  that is its symbol-name

	*  Undo previous change: html-stream must be passed a stream,
	   you can't pass in t or nil.  

2000-03-20  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  html-stream will now accept t and nil as streams and
	   then use *terminal-io* and *standard-output* respectively.

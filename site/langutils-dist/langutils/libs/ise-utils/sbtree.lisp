;;;; Purpose:       A B+ tree definition
;;;; Programmer:    Ian S. Eslick

;; ====================================
;; A B+-tree for string tagged objects
;;
;; create: O(n)
;; find:   O(log n)
;; delete: O(log n)
;; insert: O(log n)
;;
;; This can be used as a set of strings with cheap membership
;; testing or as a storage for objects tagged by a string label
;; using the :key keyword parameter to extract the string from
;; the object on which to search.  Each tree is unique so once
;; you init the tree with a key search, it always uses that keyword
;; function

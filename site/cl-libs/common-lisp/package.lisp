;;;;FILE:               package.lisp
;;;;LANGUAGE:           Common-Lisp
;;;;SYSTEM:             Common-Lisp
;;;;USER-INTERFACE:     None
;;;;DESCRIPTION
;;;;
;;;;    Exports a DEFINE-PACKAGE macro and LOAD-PACKAGE function
;;;;    (amongst others) that map packages names (styled as:
;;;;    COM.INFORMATIMAGO.COMMON-LISP.PACKAGE to logical pathnames in
;;;;    the "PACKAGES" virtual host:
;;;;
;;;;      "PACKAGES:COM;INFORMATIMAGO;COMMON-LISP;PACKAGE.LISP"
;;;;
;;;;    The object files are mapped to:
;;;;
;;;;      "PACKAGES:COM;INFORMATIMAGO;COMMON-LISP;~
;;;;       OBJ-${IMPL_TYPE}-${IMPL_VERS}-${MACH_TYPE} ;PACKAGE.${OBJECT-TYPE}"
;;;;    
;;;;    Improvements over DEFPACKAGE include:
;;;; 
;;;;        - allow to specify packages refered to (used) while not
;;;;          importing ("inheriting") any of it symbols; (:USE package)
;;;;
;;;;        - allow to do it while renaming (nicknaming) the package;
;;;;          (:USE package :AS nickname)
;;;;
;;;;        - allow to specify that all symbols exported by a given package
;;;;          are to be imported. (:FROM package :IMPORT :ALL)
;;;;
;;;;    The first and second points help declare package dependencies without
;;;;    using the deprecated REQUIRE, PROVIDE and *MODULES*.  This is done
;;;;    by implementing a systematic way to load packages (from a PACKAGE:
;;;;    logical host with logical pathname translations).
;;;;    This allows MAKE-DEPENDS to build automatically the dependency graph, 
;;;;    and LOAD-PACKAGE to load automatically the dependencies without
;;;;    the need to write an ASDF or DEFSYSTEM file.
;;;;
;;;;    The last point, along with the (:FROM package :IMPORT symbol...) form
;;;;    correct the naming of the :USE clause of DEFPACKAGE.
;;;;
;;;;    Other more obscure clauses of DEFPACKAGE (:SHADOW,
;;;;    :SHADOWING-IMPORT-FROM, :INTERN) have no equivalent
;;;;    to provide a more controled package management.

;;;;MODIFICATIONS
;;;;    2005-03-17 <PJB> Added LIST-ALL-SYMBOLS LIST-EXTERNAL-SYMBOLS
;;;;                     COPY-PACKAGE
;;;;    2005-01-13 <PJB> Renamed *VERBOSE* to *PACKAGE-VERBOSE*.
;;;;                     Note: LOAD-PACKAGE uses *LOAD-VERBOSE*.
;;;;    2004-12-19 <PJB> LOAD-PACKAGE won't load a package found by FIND-PACKAGE.
;;;;    2003-05-06 <PJB> Created.
;;;;BUGS
;;;;    Nicknames assigned with (:USE package :AS nickname) are created in
;;;;    the global package name space.  They ought to be created in a
;;;;    package name space local to the package being defined...
;;;;
;;;;    We should probably implement a hierarchical package system like Franz's.
;;;;
;;;;    ADD-NICKNAME:  RENAME-PACKAGE cannot not change the name, (undefined consequences)
;;;;                   so we'd have to go thru a temporary name.

The packages in this directory are PURE Common-Lisp packages.
They should compile and run in all Common-Lisp compliant implementation.
[inside brackets: status and issues].


Miscellaneous:
--------------

    init            Environment used by the Makefile to compile these packages.
                    Note: if your implementation needs to be brought to 
                          compliance to Common-Lisp, this is the place where 
                          to put the needed forms.

                    [nicknames handling is not local to a package, leading
                     to potential nicknames collision when using :USE/:AS].

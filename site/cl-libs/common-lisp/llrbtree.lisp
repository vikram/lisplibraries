Within the lexical scope of the BODY, NAME is defined via macrolet
such that successive invocations of (NAME) return the items, one by
one, from the LLRBL:TREE that is obtained by evaluating TREE
only once.

An invocation (NAME) returns three values as follows:

1. A generalized boolean that is true if an entry is returned.
2. The key from the tree entry.
3. The value from the tree entry.
   
After all entries have been returned by successive invocations
of (NAME), then only one value is returned, namely nil.

It is unspecified what happens if any of the implicit interior state
of an iteration is returned outside the dynamic extent of the
WITH-TREE-ITERATOR form such as by returning some closure over
the invocation form.

Any number of invocations of WITH-TREE-ITERATOR can be nested,
and the BODY of the innermost one can invoke all of the locally
established macros, provided all of those macros have distinct NAMEs.

Here is a way to "mirror" the cliki page used by asdf-install.

Darcs repository: http://darcs.informatimago.com/darcs/public/lisp/

File: http://darcs.informatimago.com/darcs/public/lisp/clmisc/asdf-system-tarball-location.lisp

It add some functions to asdf-system to keep a local copy of the assoc
between the system names and the tarball urls, and use it instead of
accessing cliki to install an asdf system.


(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :asdf-system)
(load "PACKAGE:COM;INFORMATIMAGO;COMMON-LISP;PACKAGE.LISP")
(push (function package:package-system-definition)
            asdf:*system-definition-search-functions*)
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :com.informatimago.clmisc)

(asdf-install:asc-update-cliki-tarball-locations :verbose t)
;; Updates the local cache with the tarball locations on cliki.
;; This doesn't modify the personnal associations.

(asc-list-systems)
;; gives a list of known asdf-installable system names.

(lsasc)
;; Prints the same list, with the URL of the tarballs
;; (and the last response code obtained when finding the URL
;; when it's not 200),
;; and whether the asdf system is installed and/or loaded.

(asc-system-tarball-location "split-sequence")
;; Returns the tarball URL (string).

(setf (asc-system-tarball-location system-name) tarball-url)
;; Sets a personnal tarball URL.  It may hide a cliki URL.

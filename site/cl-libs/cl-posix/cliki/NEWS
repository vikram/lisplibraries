New in CLiki 0.4.4 (not released)

* Introduce anti-spamming device: all but one version of a page is now
  served with NOFOLLOW robots tag.  That version is the newest version
  which has lasted more than 24 hours (without|before) being edited

* Bugfixes for new stuff in 0.4.3

* RSS feed now includes a pubDate element, to make aggregators
  (primarily Planet Lisp, it must be admitted) happier

* Export CHECK-PAGE-SAVE-ALLOWED (GF) and the condition 
  CLIKI-PAGE-SAVE-REJECTED, making it easier for cliki-based apps
  to do things like username checking

New in CLiki 0.4.3

* Versioning!  At the expense of making the file names correspond even
  less closely with the page title, we now produce a version per edit.

* While indexing we collect the first sentence of each page, and
  make it accessible as (CLIKI-FIRST-SENTENCE page)

* Legacy searches now print this out.

* Beginning of the long slow process to separate generic cliki engine
  stuff from www.cliki.net stuff: new cliki-net class that you
  probably don't want to use unless you're me  

* Indexing tweaks mean startup on big clikis may be a bit faster.  

* Bug fixes: RSS generation, topic searches.

* *(Uncategorized) marker added to default text for new pages.

New in CLiki 0.4.2

* Now depends on xmls package for rss generation (stop complaining at
  the back there: it's small, it's asdf-installable if you ignore the
  lack of GPG key, and it decruftifies the code noticeably)

* Tweaked the feature that allows users to collapse multiple edits to
  the same page such that they only show on Recent Changes once.  Now
  it only works if the two edits happened within ten minutes of each
  other.

* Update README to include web address for lispweb list

* 'Create new page' link to site root, and other links in the default
  HTML stuff fixed (pointed out by Erik Enge, patch from Ivan Toshkov,
  thanks both)

* example.lisp package name changed to something less clashable

New in CLiki 0.4.1

* Fixed up a couple of links in the default page header/footer to
  not point to the site root if the handler is installed elsewhere.

* Update README file to correspond to Araneida 0.81, and add
  example.lisp demonstrating a simple CLiki installation.

* Change CLIKI-INSTANCE class graph.  Now we have CLIKI-VIEW as a parent
  of CLIKI-INSTANCE.  The approximate division is that CLIKI-VIEW deals
  with the visual aspects and CLIKI-INSTANCE deals with updating and
  saving data.

* CLIKI-SKIN is a new CLIKI-VIEW subclass demonstrating a way to make
  a second look and feel for an existing cliki.

* New CLIKI-PAGE-SURROUND method replaces CLIKI-PAGE-HEADER and
  CLIKI-PAGE-FOOTER.  WITH-PAGE-SURROUND macro allows any response
  handler to reasonably conveniently use the standard surround for
  some cliki it's associated with.

* New class AUTHED-CLIKI does cookie-based authentication for clikis that 
  you don't want just anyone to edit.  Badly, though.  Feel free to send
  patches.

* At last, proper escaping of page pathnames.  Page titles may now contain
  interesting characters like #\#, #\., #\+ etc.

  If you have any pages stored in files with even mildly interesting 
  names, they will change: what was "Foo Bar" is now "Foo=20Bar", for
  example.  The old names are still read, and updated to new names on
  SAVE-PAGE (i.e. after edits).

* #\Space and #\_ are treated as equivalent in page names, just as #\A
  and #\a are.

* SAVE-PAGE is now a GF specialkised on CLIKI-VIEW.  Might be usable
  for e.g. database-backed clikis.

* Bug fix: admin/recent-changes.dat is created if not found.

* Some HTML cleanup.

New in CLiki 0.4.0

* Visual makeover.  Thanks to Miles Egan for doing the hard work, and
  apologies to him for my subsequent attempts to wreck it again.

* ?download request redirects now merge against cclan

* Very slight documentation update

* New :package tag is actually pretty similar to :download but explicitly
  for ASDF systems

* Some bug fixes: 
  - pages no longer show themselves in 'related pages' lists
  - RDF file has working link for Recent Changes page
  - empty pages can be edited again

New in CLiki 0.3.9

* Wholesale changes to take advantage of the new handler model in
  Araneida 0.69+ (i.e. you need that too)

* Potentially backward-incompatible change: now redirects requests
  for the foo.html url to the foo page.  This has been threatened 
  for years

* Default search result page gets a summary of matched text for each
  matching document

* CLIKI-DEFAULT-PAGE-NAME method lets you have a start page called something
  other than `index'

* ADD-TO-INDEX-FOR-PAGE methods can now also add their arguments to the 
  TF index, so that text in :(foo ...) constructs can be picked up in
  full-text searching 

* recent changes is now always displayed in GMT

* Javascript link in default page header method to create new page

* Removed (in hindsight, silly) >(foo) download syntax

* Targets for 0.4: perhaps some documentation.  Lift the user auth from 
  Entomotomy and include it here.  Bug fixes (please report bugs)


New in CLiki 0.3.3

* RDF RSS (0.92, insofar as it exists) export for Recent Changes

* Major changes to internal workings of search and indexes such that the
  index collection is now extensible: index.lisp should be reasonably clear.
  CLiki 0.4 will happen when some work has been done on the search side of it
  and some documentation written

* CLiki syntax (_(foo), *(bar) etc) parsing radically changed to help with
  index chages as above.  

* The latter two should have produced little or no user-visible changes to
  existing cliki pages

New in CLiki 0.3.2

* New syntax for marking the >(download) URL of a package

* Uses new Araneida cookie accessors (so yes, you need a new Araneida as well)

* Default CLHS URL changed to lisp.org, as they still have the old Hyperspec
  page names.  This is a stopgap measure, really

New in CLiki 0.3.1

* Nothing much.  Now builds using asdf

New in CLiki 0.3

* Hyperspec lookups (thanks to Eric Marsden for the code)

* A full-text search engine (thanks to Neil W. Van Dyke for
  introducing me to tfidf and pointing me at articles)

* Multiple CLiki instances can co-exist in the same Lisp instance

* Recent Changes view is now paged for speed of downloading

* Can optionally use a cookie to remember the editors' names

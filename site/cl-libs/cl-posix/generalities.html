<h1 align=center>Generalities about the Common-Lisp-POSIX API</h1>

<p>Note: This page gather some remarks made by people on news:comp.lang.lisp

<ol>

</ol>

<h2>Principles</h2>

<p>We're not merging Common-Lisp and POSIX! 

<p>We  want  to  have  access  to POSIX  primitives  from  Common-Lisp
applications as easily  as from a C application.   The POSIX API being
the Operating System Interface for the applications.

<p>In  particular,  we won't  convert  between  PATHNAMES and  strings
containing  unix  paths,  and  we  won't  convert  between  unix  file
descriptors and  Common-Lisp streams. (There may already  exist such a
conversion  function  in   the  Common-Lisp  implementation  extension
packages).




<h2>Packages</h2>

<h3>The main API</h3>


<p>This API is defined by the Single UNIX Specification version 3.

<p>It  is  recommended  that  the various  implementations  reside  in
packages named like:

  <pre>
     COM.INFORMATIMAGO.COMMON-LISP.SUSV3
     NET.SOURCEFORGE.CLISP.SUSV3
     COM.SMART-LISP-CORP.SUSV3
  </pre>

<p>The  user can  then choose  one  implementation or  the other,  and
re-nickname it to the reserved package name <code>SUSV3</code>.

<p>Note: The package name <code>POSIX</code> is already taken in various
implementations. Moreover, it's not descriptive enough.

<p>Alternative: 
<ul>
<li>Perhaps it should be named: <code>SUS3</code>.
</ul>


<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>SUSv3 defines various optional or extension API.
(See <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/help/codes.html">codes</a>).

<p>These extensions will be defined in additional packages nicknamed:

<pre>
    Nickname:       Example of package name:
    -------------   -------------------------------
    SUSV3-ADV       COM.INFORMATIMAGO.COMMON-LISP.SUSV3.ADV
    SUSV3-AIO       COM.INFORMATIMAGO.COMMON-LISP.SUSV3.AIO
    SUSV3-BAR       COM.INFORMATIMAGO.COMMON-LISP.SUSV3.BAR
    SUSV3-CPT       etc...
    SUSV3-CS

    SUSV3-SPN
    SUSV3-SS
    SUSV3-TCT
    SUSV3-TEF
    SUSV3-THR
    SUSV3-TMO
    SUSV3-TMR
    SUSV3-TPI
    SUSV3-TPP
    SUSV3-TPS
    SUSV3-TRC

    SUSV3-TSF
    SUSV3-TSH
    SUSV3-TSP
    SUSV3-TSS
    SUSV3-TYM
    SUSV3-XSI
    SUSV3-XSR
</pre>

<p>Some code may not be relevant to a Common-Lisp API.


<p>Alternatives:
<ul>
<li> Use the *FEATURES* system. 
    <p>I don't like this option, leading to the use of #+ and #-. 
</ul>

<p>Note: When  defining lisp structures,  we put all the  fields, even
the optional ones that will be  used only when the optional feature is
available.  
<!--
The reason  is because  a given  lisp application  may be
compiled or run on different SUSv3 systems with different sets of options.
-->

<p>[***SEE***: We need a mean to determine if a given extension is available.
<p>Should each package export an AVAILABLE-P predicate? ]



<h2>The Symbols</h2>

<p>A symbol name is derived from the C binding's name, by:
<ol>
<li> uppercasing, then 
<li> replacing underscore (#\_) characters with the hyphen (#\-)
<li> where the fields of a C structure all have a common prefix 
    (for example, "st_"), we omit it.
<li> constant names get prefix and suffix '+'s.
</ol>
<p>No other changes to "Lispify" symbol names are made, so <code>creat()</code>
becomes <code>CREAT</code>, not <code>CREATE</code>.

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<p>Lisp constants, types, and  structures are defined corresponding to
the constants, types and structures in the C API.

<p>The API is defined in terms of Common-Lisp.

<ol>

<li> length arguments are omitted or optional where the sensible value
is obvious.  For example:
<pre>
(read fd buffer &optional (length (length buffer))) => bytes-read
</pre>

<li> where C simulates "out" parameters using pointers (for instance,
in pipe() or socketpair()) we shall use multiple return values
instead, primary return value always first, then the others in left to
right order.
<p>[***SEE***: This doesn't apply to data transfer functions that fill buffers.]

</ol>

<p>Note:  We  won't  allow  passing  pathnames  as  unix  path  string
parameters.   Common-Lisp pathnames are  messy, no  two implementation
can agree on their exact semantic, so it would defeat portability.



<h2>Return values</h2>

<p>The return value is usually the same as for the C binding, except in
error cases: where the C function is defined as returning some
sentinel value and setting "errno" on error, we instead signal a
condition of type SYSCALL-ERROR.  The actual error value ("errno") is
stored in this condition and can be accessed with SYSCALL-ERRNO.
[***SEE***: some interface to strerror, to get the user-readable translation
of the error number]

<p>We do not automatically translate the returned value into "Lispy"
objects - for example, POSIX:OPEN returns a small integer, not a
stream.

<p>Rationale: This is an interface to POSIX, not a high-level interface
that uses POSIX, and many people using it will actually want to mess
with the file descriptors directly.  People needing Lispy interfaces
can implement them atop this - or indeed, use the existing COMMON-LISP
package, which already has many high-level constructs built on top of
the operating system.



<h2>Issues</h2>

<ul>

    <li>Constants may be replaced by keywords (for example: error codes).

    <li>What to do with variable-length functions
        like execvp()? Do they take a list, or vector or either? 
        Don't forget that execlp etc. IMHO have no place in a foreign language
        binding. These are just C wrappers to execv(), execve() and execv().

    <li>there are functions whose semantics are to initialize a C object,
        like sigemptyset(). You probably want to keep it that way, rather
        than turn sigemptyset() into a constructor that returns a a brand
        new, empty signal set. Or it could have both behaviors: the set
        could be returned as a second value, which is identical to the
        optional argument if it is present, or a new object if the
        argument is missing.

    <li>(Seems to be more a FFI issue):
    <p>Similarly, interfacing to [f]printf() is superfluous. vfprintf() is
    mandatory when coming from a foreign language.  Which is *not* to say
    that there should be no POSIX:PRINTF.  I'm all in favour of it! But it
    is more likely to expand to a call to vprintf(), especially in some
    implementations which create calls at run-time, instead of
    generating compile-time native-code.
    <pre>
    (defun posix:fprintf (fp format &rest args)
      (posix:vfprintf fp format (coerce args 'vector)))
    </pre>
    <p>A compiler-macro optimization might handle the case when posix:printf
    is called literally, i.e. with a known number of arguments, on those
    systems which generate native-code.
    <p>I have yet to see non-wrapper FFI definitions for variable-arg functions.

    <p>
    Which leads to another question: how to deal with [vsnf]printf and its
    sisters' arguments which are all polymorphic??
    <ol>
    <li><pre>
            (typecase
             ((unsigned-int 32) ...
              (signed-int   32) ...
              single-float      ...
              string            ...
              (array fixnum)
              (array ...
              ...
              FFI-pointer
        </pre>
        <li> ?
    </ol>

    <li>
    There are a few cases where C parameters are "optional out",
    e.g. sigaction().  C programmers can elect to pass in either a NULL or
    a data pointer. I'm not sure whether this is covered by your rule.
    <p>
    sigaction() is more like [newact] [oldact] whereas &optional always
    implies [newact [oldact]], i.e. you cannot leave out the first.
    The performance penalty of choosing to always create and return a
    sigact structure vs. the C programmer's freedom to choose is debatable.


    <li>
    Also, reading into Lisp string buffers may be very
    problematic. E.g. CLISP internally uses 16 or 32 bit characters
    because it supports UNICODE, whereas most western day-to-day use
    involves one byte ASCII or ISO-8859-1.
    Do you plan to support reading into existing Lisp strings as part of
    your API? Or would you just return new strings (using which encoding?)?
    <p>
    Note: SUSv3 has provision of locales and multibytes characters!

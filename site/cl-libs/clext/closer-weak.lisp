;;;;DESCRIPTION
;;;;    
;;;;    Closer to Weak objects.
;;;;    Implements the specification: http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/weak.html
;;;;    for Common Lisp implementations that have weak-pointers.
;;;;
;;;;    WEAK-OR-RELATION is a primitive that cannot be implemented propertly
;;;;    without implementation support.
;;;;
;;;;    Currently work on:
;;;;           clisp      full support
;;;;           cmucl      partial support (missing WEAK-OR-RELATION)
;;;;           sbcl       partial support (missing WEAK-OR-RELATION)
;;;;
;;;;    Read-time Features:
;;;;
;;;;        :WEAK-TEST    When testing, call the garbage collector
;;;;                      to break weak pointers sooner.
;;;;
;;;;        :DEBUG-WEAK   When compiling on clisp, use this implementation
;;;;                      instead of the native one.

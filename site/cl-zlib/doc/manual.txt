*UNCOMPRESS-BUFFER-SCALE-FACTOR* (4)                            [PARAMETER]
   Buffer increased to this value times then UNCOMPRESS-STRING

   Length of buffer for reading (GZ-READ-LINE).
   Doesn't affect the actual length of returning string.

ZCOMPRESS (source sourcelen dest)                                [FUNCTION]
   Compress the first SOURCELEN bytes of SOURCE into DEST. DEST should
   be an array of (unsigned-byte 8), and should be large enough to hold
   the compressed contents. Returns the compressed length.
   Note that the size of the DEST array should be at least 0.1% more
   than sourcelen plus 12 bytes, but the actual number of array elements
   filled in by the compression algorithm will usually be smaller
   (depending on how 'predictable' the input data is).

ZUNCOMPRESS (source sourcelen dest)                              [FUNCTION]
   Uncompress the first SOURCELEN bytes of SOURCE into DEST. DEST
   should be long enough to hold the uncompressed contents. Returns the
   uncompressed length.

COMPRESS-STRING (source)                                         [FUNCTION]
   Returns two values: array of bytes containing the compressed data
   and the number of compressed bytes

UNCOMPRESS-STRING (source &optional destsize)                    [FUNCTION]
   Uncompress the contents of the SOURCE byte array to a string.
   DESTSIZE is the length of the resulting string (it should be recorded
   during compression).

GZ-OPEN (pathname &optional (direction :input))                  [FUNCTION]
   Open a compressed stream to the given PATHNAME. The optional 
   argument DIRECTION should be one of :input (the default) or 
   :output. If an existing file is opened for output, it is truncated 
   to zero length.

GZ-READ (file-descriptor len)                                    [FUNCTION]
   Read LEN uncompressed bytes from FILE-DESCRIPTOR of compressed file
   opened with GZ-OPEN. If the input file was not in gzip format,
   GZ-READ copies the given number of bytes. GZ-READ returns the string
   and number of bytes actually read or FALSE in case of error.

GZ-WRITE (file-descriptor str &optional (len (length str)))      [FUNCTION]
   Write STR into the FILE-DESCRIPTOR of compressed file
   opened with GZ-OPEN.
   Returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually written or FALSE
   in case of error.

GZ-READ-LINE (file-descriptor &optional (eof-error-p t) eof)     [FUNCTION]
   Read a line of text from the FILE-DESCRIPTOR of compressed file
   opened with GZ-OPEN.
   Returns the uncompressed string or
   EOF and FALSE in case of error.

GZ-WRITE-LINE (file-descriptor str)                              [FUNCTION]
   Write the string STR to the FILE-DESCRIPTOR of compressed file
   opened with GZ-OPEN.
   Returns the number of characters written, or FALSE in case of error.

WITH-GZ ((fd filename &key (direction :input)) &body forms)         [MACRO]
   Open FILENAME using gz-open with the specified DIRECTION, assign
   the open file to FD and exectute FORMS.

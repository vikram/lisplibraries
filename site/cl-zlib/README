This package contains a foreign-function interface to the zlib
compression library (version 1.1.3). The functions in this package
allow you to:

- perform in-memory compression and decompression of strings and
arbitrary byte arrays;

- read and write compressed files in gzip format.

INSTALLATION

Installation of the package is ASDF-oriented.

1. Add this directory to the variable ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*

2. At the Lisp prompt type

(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op "split-sequence")

This will compile and load the package into your running lisp.
If compilation is failed at zlib library loading look at
*zlib-search-paths* and *zlib-names* variables in "cl-zlib.lisp".

3. If you want to run existing tests then at the Lisp prompt type

(load "test.lisp")
(zlib-test:zlib-test)

RUNNING CL-ZLIB

See the source file, tests and the manual.txt file for documentation and
examples. See LICENSE.txt for licensing details. The zlib library is
available at http://www.zlib.org/. This code was tested with CMUCL-19b
under GNU/Linux only.

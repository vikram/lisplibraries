;;;; * Tests

;;;; While executing checks and collecting the results is the core job
;;;; of a testing framework it is also important to be able to
;;;; organize checks into groups, FiveAM provides two mechanisms for
;;;; organizing checks: tests and test suites. A test is a named
;;;; collection of checks which can be run and a test suite is a named
;;;; collection of tests and test suites.

(defmacro test (name &body body)
  "Create a test named NAME. If NAME is a list it must be of the
form:

  (name &key depends-on suite)

NAME is the symbol which names the test.

DEPENDS-ON is a list of the form:

 (AND . test-names) - This test is run only if all of the tests
 in TEST-NAMES have passed, otherwise a single test-skipped
 result is generated.

 (OR . test-names) - If any of TEST-NAMES has passed this test is
 run, otherwise a test-skipped result is generated.

 (NOT test-name) - This is test is run only if TEST-NAME failed.

AND, OR and NOT can be combined to produce complex dependencies.

If DEPENDS-ON is a symbol it is interpreted as `(AND
,depends-on), this is accomadate the common case of one test
depending on another.

SUITE defaults to the current value of *SUITE*."

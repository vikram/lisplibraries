Greylisting makes use of mysql so you'll need to have mysql installed
and running on your system.  Included in this distribution is a sql
script (greylist.sql) to create the greylist database for you.  You
will definitely want to edit at least the last line of the script to
adjust the password for the greylist mysql user.

To run the script, issue the following commands as root:

mysql
source greylist.sql;
quit

Some default installations of mysql have access permissions set up in
such a way that maild's login using the greylist account fails.  If
you see errors in the mail log about mysql connection failures, try
this:

mysql mysql
delete from user where user is null or user = "";
flush privileges;
quit

Please read the Mysql documentation for more information on how the
privilege systems works.

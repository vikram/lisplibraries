2009-05-09  layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* Makefile:
	- look for and include Makefile.local, so predefined variables
	  can be overridden
	- use ?= in a bunch of places so Makefile.local can provide
	  default values
	- remove $(at_franz); use $(REMOVE_PREVIOUS_VERSIONS) instead

2009-05-09  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.19
	
	* deliver-smtp.cl: Some servers say "SIZE 0" during EHLO.
	Interpret this to mean that it supports the SIZE extension,
	but it doesn't have a fixed maximum message size.

2009-05-06  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.18 

	Tweaks for bandwidth reduction in the face of large messages:
	
	* bounce.cl:  Only send the first
	*bounce-max-original-msg-lines* (defaults to 300) lines of the
	original message in bounces.  This helps prevent bounces from
	bouncing if the original message was rejected for being too
	large.

	* config.cl:  New *bounce-max-original-msg-lines* parameter.

	* deliver-smtp.cl: use EHLO and honor the server's reported
	max message size (if any) to avoid wasting bandwidth
	transmitting a message that will ultimately be rejected.
	Likewise, supply the SIZE= parameter during MAIL FROM: if the
	server supports it.

	* deliver.cl: 

	write-message-to-stream: Support new max-lines keyword
	arg (used by bounce.cl).

	read-message-from-stream:  Keep track of the "smtp byte count"
	of messages as they are read in so we can use the information
	when relaying via SMTP.  

	* queue.cl: Added smtp-size slot to hold computed "smtp byte
	count".

	* smtp-server.cl: Report *maxmsgsize* (if set) in EHLO
	response.  Support SIZE= parameter in MAIL FROM: command.

	
2008-08-18  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* Makefile: more tweaks for non-franz building, of the rpm and
	  repo installation, this time.

2008-07-31  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* Makefile: make --sign a make variable, so I can specify it
	  as null

2008-07-30  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.2.17
	* blacklist.cl, smtp-server-checkers.cl: Never run blacklist
	checks against trusted clients.

2008-04-09  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.2.16
	
	* greylist.cl: Added dnswl.org support in the greylisting module.
	Greylisting is bypassed for IPs found in dnswl.org.

	* deliver.cl: Remove extra newlines when reporting stdout/stderr
	from delivery program.

	* maild.spec.in: Added %define debug_package %{nil} to avoid
	building the debuginfo package (which doesn't currently work w/
	8.1 shared lib).
	
2007-07-23  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.15
	
	* smtp-server.cl: bug17189.  Reduce memory leaks caused by failing
	to close the ssl-server-stream created by the STARTTLS command.  A
	leak still exists in the real C heap, though. 

2007-07-18  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.14
	
	* Just a version bump for 8.1rc1 build.

2007-05-30  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.13

        * config.cl: Added new config parametr *maxheadersize* which
	defaults to 32768.  Messages with total header size larger than
	this will be rejected.

	* input.cl: 

	Adjusted read-message-stream so that it checks the
	maximum header size and returns a complaint if exceeded.  

	Header lines longer than *maxdatalinelen* are handled properly
	now.

	read-message-stream now returns information about any size
	constraint violations (headers or total message size) to the
	caller.

	read-from-stdin will now properly generate an error for messages
	that exceeded size contraints.
	
	* checkers.cl: Removed message-size-checker.  It's function has
	been integrated into input.cl:read-message-stream.

	* smtp-server.cl: smtp-data.  Allow either :err or :reject return
	status from smtp-data-checkers.
	

2007-05-18  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.12
	
	* Built with 8.1.beta with bug17033 fixes.

	* config.cl: Added *postpone-checkers* setting for postponing most
	spam checks until after message data has been received.  This is
	to help w/ the KDDI project.

	* deliver-smtp.cl: Added missing word to an error message.

	* smtp-server.cl:  New statistic: transactions-started.  Counts
	number of successful MAIL FROM commands.  

	* smtp-server.cl: Many changes in order to implement
	*postpone-checkers* option.

	* www.cl: Added display for transactions started stat.

2007-05-09  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.9
	
	* Rebuild w/ latest 8.1.beta.

	* config.cl: Default ssl key file is now /etc/maild.key

2007-04-24  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.8
	
	* Version number bump to easily identify 8.1.beta build.

	* load.cl: Include :mcombin in module list (unless version>= 8 1)

2007-04-12  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.7
	
	* maild.cl: Added support for -bD run mode.. which is the same as
	-bd, but does not fork, and turns on debugging mode.

2007-03-21  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.6
	* delivr-smtp.cl Fix suspected fd leak during failed SMTP delivery.

2007-03-01  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.5
       * deliver-smtp.cl: Bugfix to prior change.
	
1.2.4
	
	* deliver-smtp.cl: Improve error reporting for MX connection
	failures.  Also, always make connections to port 25, not
	*smtp-port* (which is used to define the port that maild listens
	on).
	

2007-02-06  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.3
	
	* config.cl: Added *smtps-port* parameter.  Removed comment from
	*smtp-port* parameter.

	* headers.cl: Construct message ids in a better way.

	* smtp-server.cl: Use *smtp-port* always.  Ignore 'smtp' entry in
	/etc/services.  This makes it easier to run maild on a
	non-standard port.

2007-01-08  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.2
	
	* queue.cl: queue-finalize: Only call queue-prefinalize if it
	hasn't been called before.

	* config.cl: Fixed typo in comment.

2006-11-15  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.1
	
	* queue.cl: queue-prefinalize: Copy the headers list since it may
	be destructively modified by subsequent calls to
	queue-append-header.  

	* smtp-server.cl: with-smtp-err-handler: Print socket errors in a
	nicer way.

2006-11-14  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.2.0

	* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Adjusted the way (smtp and non-smtp) data
	checkers are invoked.  If you use checkers in your /etc/maild.cl,
	you'll need to update their argument lists and code.  The
	'external-checker' function has also been changed.

	* Added *metoo* configuration variable to force senders who send
	mail to a mailing list their on to get a copy of that mail.

	* smtp-server.cl:  Added an error handler which will log a
	backtrace in the case of unexpected errors.

2006-10-05  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.70
	
	* greyadmin/greyadmin.cl: Updated to use PAM auth.

2006-10-02  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.69:
       
	* deliver-smtp.cl, get-smtp-reply: Collect all the server's
	response for proper reporting in bounce messages.

	* queue-process.cl: Fixed case where 'nil' would be printed in a
	bounce message instead of a recipient address.

2006-09-14  root  <root@gills2.dancysoft.com>
1.1.67/1.1.68
       
	* smtp-server.cl, do-smtp: Adjusted pre-greeting traffic check so
	that it doesn't treat client disconnect as traffic.
	
1.1.66:

	* Makefile/maild*.spec.in: Default release number (1) is specified
	in Makefile and can be overridden with an environment variable.

	* config.cl: New *greet-pause*.

	* smtp-server.cl: Add support for *greet-pause* setting.  See docs
	near *greet-pause* in config.cl for details.  Right now
	pre-greeting traffic is simply logged.  After a testing period, it
	will be changed to disconnection violators.
	
1.1.65:

        *** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES *** /etc/maild.cl may need to be updated.
	
	* config.cl: Replaced *relay-access* and *relay-checkers* with
	*trusted-clients* and *trusted-client-checker*.  trusted client
	checkers just take a single argument: the ip address of the
	client.

	* greylist.cl, greylist-init: Replaced call to relaying-allowed-p
	to trusted-client-p.  Also moved the check to the top of the function.

	* smtp-server-checkers.cl: Replaced calls to relaying-allowed-p to
	trusted-client-p.  Removed function 'check-relay-access'.  

	* utils.cl:  Added functions 'addr-in-list-p' and 'trusted-client-p'
	
2006-09-12  root  <root@gills2.dancysoft.com>
	* *.spec.in:  Chmod 0700 /var/spool/maild.

	* greylist.sql: Adjusted grant statement per jkfs recommendation.

2006-08-27  root  <root@gills2.dancysoft.com>
1.1.64
        * config.cl:  New option: *pid-file*, defaults to /var/run/maild.pid.

	* smtp-server.cl: If *pid-file* is true, record the process at the
	specified location at SMTP server startup.  Use an unwind-protect
	to clean it up during shutdown.

2006-08-26  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.63

	* aliases.cl: Don't log "Reparsing aliases" if aliases hadn't been
	parsed at all yet (such as when starting maild from the command
	line).  Rearranged some code and structures to make the system
	more robust in case of alias parsing errors.  Fixed bug where 'eq'
	was being used to compare file-write-dates.  file-write-dates tend
	to be bignums so will 'eq' will return nil for two bignums that
	look the same.  Changed to 'eql' (not using = because 'nil' may be
	returned for non-existent files).

2006-08-25  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.62
	
	* Removed pam.cl since it's in Allegro CL now.

2006-08-23  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* load.cl: Added :regexp2 to the module list for building.

2006-08-21  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.61
	
	* Use different pam files for modern redhat/fedora and redhat 7.3.

2006-08-17  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.60
	
	* aliases.cl: BUGFIX: If parsing of system aliases file was
	aborted due to incorrect owner/permissions, it would never be
	reparsed again.  Fixed.

2006-08-11  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.59

	* greylist.cl: Additional "don't greylist authenticate clients"
	fix.

1.1.58
	
	* config.cl: Comment updates for some checkers.

	* greylist.cl: Don't greylist authenticated clients (fix).

	* smtp-server-checkers.cl: Call smtp-data-checkers with 'sess' as first arg.

2006-08-08  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.57
	
	* Makefile:  Pass -W arg to lisp when building.

	* smtp-server.cl: In places where checkers are called, if one of
	them returns :sufficient, then skip the remaining checkers in the
	list.

	Call data-pre-checkers with 'sess' as first argument.
	
	* smtp-server-checkers.cl (smtp-rcpt-to-relay-checker): Return
	:sufficient if client has authenticated or is in the
	allowed-to-relay list.

	* greylist.cl (greylist-data-pre-checker): Return :ok if client is
	authenticated.

2006-08-08  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* Makefile: tweaks to make suse rpm build work

2006-08-08  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.56
	
	* Makefile: Use maild.pam.suse when building on SuSE.  

	* maild.pam.suse: New.

2006-08-06  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* Makefile: tweaks for SuSE

2006-07-30  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.55

	* Makefile, *.spec.in, auth.cl, load.cl:
	Changed client authentication code so that it uses PAM now.
	Updated RPM specs to supply /etc/pam.d/smtp.

	* maild.pam, pam.cl: New

	* config.cl: Fixed the documentation for *client-authentication*

2006-07-05  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.54
	* config.cl: New parameter: *rcpt-to-negative-initial-delay*,
	defaults to 5 (seconds).  

	* smtp-server.cl: If RCPT TO is to fail with 4xx or 5xx code,
	sleep for a while before reporting the failure.  Initially, sleep
	for *rcpt-to-negative-initial-delay* seconds, then double each
	subsequent time.  This is to slow down dictionary spam attacks.

2006-06-14  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.53
	
	* Include "5.7.1" prefix on Relaying denied response.

2006-04-12  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.52
	When adding a From: header, quote the gecos information if
	necessary:

	* emailaddr.cl: New function: quote-if-necessary.

	* header.cl: make-from-header: Make use of quote-if-necessary.

2006-04-09  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.51

	* greylist.sql: For whitelist table, do not specify 'not null' for
	the expire column.  A NULL in the expire column indicates a record
	that should not expire.  Manually issue this SQL statement to fix
	your whitelist table definition if necessary:

	alter table whitelist modify expire bigint;	

	* aliases.cl: Fix processing of continuation lines.

1.1.50
        * aliases.cl:  Be tolerant of syntax errors during parsing of 
	aliases files. 
	
1.1.49

	* config.cl: Updated some comments.  Removed *short-host-name*
	since it's not really a configuration parameter.  

	* dns.cl: Minor reformatting.

	* recips.cl: local-domain-p: Include (gethostname) in the list of
	domains to automatically include.

	* rewrite.cl: this-host-p: Include (gethostname) in the list of
	domains to automatically include.

	* utils.cl: Minor reformatting.

2006-03-30  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.48
        * utils.cl: Additional adjustments to fix bugs related to SSL
	connections. 

2006-03-30  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.47

	* utils.cl:  Updated socketp macro so that it recognizes
	excl::ssl-server-stream's as sockets.  This fixes a bug where SSL
	connections were not being closed properly.

	* smtp-server.cl: Modified smtp-remote-host so that it returns 0
	if argument is not a socket.  Modified smtp-remote-dotted so that
	it returns "[local]" if argument is not a socket.

2006-03-27  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.46
	
	* maild.cl, main function:  Set umask to 022 before doing any file
	i/o.  

2006-03-21  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.45
	
	* bounce.cl: Adjusted bounce message appearance.

	* deliver-smtp.cl: Try to generate better delivery status
	information to aid in diagnosis of problems.

2006-03-04  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

        * greyadmin/greyadmin.cl: Changed default *libdir* to
	/usr/lib/greyadmin.
	
	* maild-rh73.spec.in: Bumped released to 2 for greyadmin fix.

2006-03-01  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Additional rpm-related mods.

2006-03-01  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.44
	* Changes to various files to support RPM packaging.

2006-02-28  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.43
	
	* config.cl: Bump *queue-max-threads* down to 10.  20 was too
	aggressive on some systems.

	* queue-process.cl: Bugfix.  There was a race condition between
	checking the number of running threads and the inc of the running
	thread counter when a new queue processing thread was started.
	This could result in extra threads being spawned.
	
2005-12-19  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.42:
	
	* Makefile: Mods to Kevin's recent changes.  Use /etc/init.d/maild
	instead of /etc/rc.d/maild.  On SuSE /etc/rc.d is a symlink to
	/etc/init.d.  /etc/rc.d does not exist on Redhat systems.  Also,
	install /etc/init.d/maild before attempting to use it.  And don't
	fail if maild isn't running when the stop attempt occurs.

	* deliver-smtp.cl, deliver.cl, queue-process.cl: Better status
	information in the queue file.  More robust error handling and
	reporting.  Recompute local mailer each time a recipient is
	processed.

	* mailer.cl: Comment changes.

	* recips.cl: New special-recip-p function.  Misc cosmetic changes.
	
	* aliases.cl, queue.cl: Minor cosmetic changes.

2005-12-19  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* Makefile: install-stop/start around install; install-greyadmin

2005-12-18  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.41
	
	* Makefile: Build using latest 8.0.

	* config.cl: New parameter *queue-max-threads* (default 20).
	Determines the maximum number of parallel threads to use during
	automatic queue processing.  This improves the flow of queued mail
	on hosts that run mailing lists (such as pandorabots).

	* queue-process.cl: Make use of new *queue-max-threads*.

2005-11-29  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.40
	* greylist.cl: Fixed argument list for greylist-rcpt-to-checker.
	It was out of date.

2005-11-28  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.39
	
	* aliases.cl:  recip-expanded-from wasn't being set properly and
	was causing unhandled errors in the bounce code.  Fixed.

	* config.cl:  Added a comment on the use of *short-host-name*. 

2005-10-26  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.38


	* Makefile: Changed alt_lisp1 to /storage1/acl80b/mlisp

	* utils.cl: New get-line function.
	
	* deliver.cl: When delivering to a file, escape "From " lines.

2005-10-11  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.37 

	* Makefile: Fixed 'arch' variable (x86 should have been 86).
	Parameterized the preferred build lisp.  Use the same lisp to
	build greyadmin.

	* version.cl.  Bumped to 1.1.37 to indicate 8.0.beta build.  Added
	an Id tag.

2005-10-10  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* Makefile: default to `mlisp'; all does clean first
	* lock.cl: use mp:process-sleep instead of sleep, since 8.0's
	  definition changed to not allow the `whostate' optional.

2005-09-23  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.36
	
	* maild.cl: Log when maild is terminated via signal.

	* auth.cl: Adding to repository (late).

2005-09-22  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.35
	
	* Fix client authentication sanity check in maild.cl

2005-09-21  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.34

	* Added support for client authentication using plain-text
	mechanisms (which allow for the standard password database
	mechanisms to be used).  By default, ssl is required before
	authentication can be performed (so that the plaintext passwords
	are not transferred in the clear).  

	* maild.cl:  Moved the /tmp/maild.trace stuff to smtp-server.cl.

	* sasl.cl: New.

	* smtp-server-checkers.cl:  rcpt-to checkers now take the SMTP
	session structure as the first argument.  The relay checker now
	checks to see if the client is authenticate.  If so, then relaying
	is allowed.  

	* smtp-server.cl:  Only open /tmp/maild.trace if the REP server is
	running. 

2005-09-16  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.33
	
	* Bugfix from 1.1.32.  Allow EHLO/HELO again after STARTTLS.

2005-09-15  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.32
	
	* Added support for SMTP/SSL (on port 465) and STARTTLS on port 25.

2005-09-07  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.31
	
	* emailaddr.cl: In quoted text, loosen the restrictions on the
	allowed characters.  Yahoo allows 8-bit characters to pass
	through.

2005-06-15  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.30
      
	* deliver-smtp.cl: Fixed bug when greylist is enabled and
	auto-whitelisting outgoing recips is enabled and the sender is <>.

	* queue-process.cl: Fixed typo in a log message.

2005-06-15  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.29

       * aliases.cl, mailer.cl, recips.cl, MAILERS.txt

       The recip struct has changed.  Do a clean build.
	
       Fixes to the address extension stuff.  As a side effect, some
       incompatible changes to the way mailers work have been made:
	
	********** Incompatible changes made **************

	mailer command line construction function is now called with
	two arguments: The recip struct and the queue struct.  Before,
	the first argument was the parsed email addr of the recip.  If you
	have custom mailer definitions, you'll need to update.

	*****************************************************	

	* config.cl: Comments only

	* utils.cl: Added fqdn-p (for future use w/ SPF)

2005-06-13  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>
1.1.28

        * deliver-smtp.cl, greylist.cl, greylist.sql, load.cl:
	
	Added support for adding auto-whitelist entries for addresses
	that local users send mail to.  An entry will be made in the 
	whitelist table that allows return from the original recipient
	to come in without being delayed by greylisting.

	**** GREYLIST DATABASE CHANGES REQUIRED ****

	Issue the following statements:

	(e.g., "mysql greylist", then:)

	alter table whitelist add expire bigint;
	create index ind6 on whitelist (expire);

	********************************************

	
	* config.cl and input.cl: Comment changes only

	* recips.cl: Made local-domain-p more convenient (argument may be 
	a string now).
	
1.1.27
      
        * aliases.cl, config.cl, mailer.cl:

	 Added support for address extensions via
	*address-extension-delimiter*.  See the notes for
	*address-extension-delimiter* in config.cl.

	* recips.cl, utils.cl:  Just comments.

	
2005-06-08  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* maild-installer:  Restart maild if it was stopped by the installer.

	* Makefile: 

	Added a 'dist' rule to make a distribution tarball.  Augmented the
	'clean' rule to clean up the tarballs.

	* maild-installer (new).  Installation script suitable for RedHat
	linux and possibly others.

	* maild-init: Changed default queue processing interval to 15
	minutes.  Default can be overridden in /etc/sysconfig/maild.
	Also, don't silently exit if /usr/local/sbin/maild doesn't exist.
	This is a situation that warrants a noticeable complaint.  I'm not
	sure why the sendmail init script works that way.
	
	
2005-05-20  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* Makefile: Make sure maild is installed setuid root.

2005-04-06  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.26

	* ALIASES: New document describing Allegro Maild's aliasing
	features.

	* recips.cl: Added utility function: augment-recip-with-domain.

	* aliases.cl: Added support for include files which are locked to
	a particular domain.  Added support for user include files which
	are also locked to a particular domain.. and which have many
	restrictions on use.

2005-04-05  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.1.25
	
	* aliases.cl: Allow system aliases file to include other aliases
	files (This isn't the same as using :include: on the right hand
	side of an alias.. which would only define the expansion for a
	single left hand side).  Included alias files are subject to the
	same security restrictions that the global aliases file is (i.e,
	must be owned by root and must not be group/world writable).

	* Makefile: Also look for mlisp in /storage1/acl70.

2004-12-20  Kevin Layer  <layer@gemini>
1.1.24

	* Makefile,
	* greyadmin/Makefile: use 7.0

2004-11-14  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>
1.1.23

	* Makefile: build greyadmin, too
	* config.cl: add *rep-server-port* and *rep-start-server*
	* load.cl: add rep-server.cl
	* maild.cl: maybe start rep server
	* (NEW) rep-server.cl: read-eval-print loop via telnet

2004-11-10  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>
1.1.22

	* Makefile:
	- work in progress for building an RPM package
	- batch mode to compile
	* (NEW) config-greyadmin.cl -- demo config file
	* (NEW) config-maild-greylist.cl -- demo config file
	* (NEW) config-maild.cl -- demo config file
	* deliver-smtp.cl: change maild-log call to maild-log-and-print to
	  fix wrong number of args problem
	* log.cl: bullet proof the logging against possible errors

2004-09-26  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* version.cl: 1.1.21:

	* greylist.cl: Allow for *@domain.com style entries in optin and
	optout tables.

2004-09-13  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: 1.1.20
	 
	* Conditionalize tests in process-dead-p for 7.0

2004-09-06  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* version.cl: 1.1.19

	* If a fully qualiified left hand side is specified in the aliases
	file, then the associated owner- alias (if there is one) must be
	fully qualified as well.

	* smtp-server.cl: Rudimentary EHLO support.  May add STARTTLS
	soon.

2004-08-16  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

        * version.cl: 1.1.18
	
	* bounce.cl: Fix problem when generating bounce message when the
	recipient was a program.

2004-07-21  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: 1.1.17

	* greylist.cl:  greylist-whitelisted-sender-p:  Add special case
	for null sender.

2004-07-14  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: 1.1.16

	* greylist.cl/sql:  Made the whitelist database more flexible.
	receiver column can be '*' to indicate a global whitelist.  sender
	column can be '*@domain' to whitelist an entire domain.  

	---
	greyadmin/

  	* greyadmin.cl/menu.clp: Added ability for users to manage their
	own whitelist entries.

2004-07-08  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* greylist.cl [updated]: Print ip address properly when logging
	manually whitelisted senders.

	* version.cl: 1.1.15

	* greylist.cl: If a particular sender address is in the
	'whitelist' table of the greylist database, excuse from
	greylisting.  This feature should be used with care since it is
	trivial for spammers to forge sender addresses.  If you are
	upgrading from a prior version, you'll need to create the
	whitelist table and index.  See greylist.sql for the two sql
	statements.

	* greylist.sql: Updated to include creation of the whitelist table
	and index.

2004-01-12  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: 1.1.14

	* log.cl:  Added function maild-log-and-print for use with verbose
	operation modes.

	* deliver-smtp.cl, queue-process.cl: improve verbosity.

	* greylist.sql.notes:  Minor reformat.

2004-01-07  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* version.cl: 1.1.13

	* greylist.cl: delete expired records before doing triple lookups.
	Note:  This will make greyadmin report incorrect information.  

	* greyadmin/{greyadmin.cl,login.clp}:  Added support code for putting keyboard focus
	into the login edit box.

	* greyadmin/menu.clp:  Removed statistics.  Accurate information
	cannot be gleaned since expired records are removed now.  Also
	removed the never-reattempted list.  It was useless most of the
	time and most people don't know how to interpret the information
	correctly.  It never should have been added in the first place.

2003-12-18  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: 1.1.12

	* queue.cl: Set the queue status string to "Ready for delivery" in
	queue-finalize.

	* smtp-server.cl: Changed the regular expression for mail from:
	and rcpt to: commands so that trailing spaces are ignored properly.

2003-12-17  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* version.cl: 1.1.11

	* greylist.cl: Shuffled around some checks to avoid duplicate
	checking.  Also, when doing post-DATA checking, make sure the
	check is run on all indenteded recipients, even if one of them
	will cause the message to be delayed.  This way, the
	auto-whitelisting will happen at the same time for all recips.

2003-10-17  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

        * maild.cl: Don't say "Maild terminating..." in the signal handler
	anymore.  Added *sighup* to the list of signals to catch.  Make
	sure the signal hander returns t to indicate that it doesn't want
	other signal handlers to execute.  This removes the need for (setf
	(mp::process-interruptible-p process) nil) in queue.cl.

2003-10-14  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* queue.cl: Added (setf (mp::process-interruptible-p process) nil)
	to the code that creates the lock refresher thread so that the
	thread is invisible to control-c's.

2003-09-30  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* version.cl: 1.1.10

	* config.cl:  New config options:

	*queue-lock-timeout* 
	*queue-lock-refresh-interval*

	which default to 15 and 10 minutes respectively.  Queue locks that
	haven't been refreshed for more than *queue-lock-timeout* seconds
	are considered to be stale.  Under normal circumstances, queue
	locks are refreshed every *queue-lock-refresh-interval* seconds.

	* lock.cl:  Added stale lock handling functions.

	* queue-process.cl:  Incomplete queue files are now removed
	automatically during queue processing.

	* queue.cl:  When a queue file is locked, a thread starts which
	refreshes the lockfile periodically.  

	* utils.cl:  Added utility functions for thread death and waiting
	for a thread to die.  These should be implemented in acl70 and can
	be removed from this file at that time.


2003-09-19  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: 1.1.9

	* headers.cl:  Fixed daylight savings time problem when generating
	date header.

	* config.cl:  New *smtp-data-checkers* variable to hold a list of
	checkers that should be called after the message data has been
	received in an SMTP session but before the response is sent.
	This is different than the "checker" checkers that happen for all
	messages, regardless of their means of reception (smtp, stdin).  

	* smtp-server.cl:  Use the new *smtp-data-checkers* list.

	* smtp-server-checkers.cl:  New utility function to add things to
	the *smtp-data-checkers* list.

	* greylist.cl:  New config parameter:
	*greylist-after-data-received*.  If set to true, greylisting
	checks will only be done after the message is received during the
	DATA command.  This allegedly helps interoperability with some
	mail servers.  However, this has a potentially undesirable side
	effect.  When this option is turned off, a message arriving for
	several recipients will have each recipient deferred or accepted
	individually.  With this option turned on, if any one recipient
	should be deferred, the message is deferred for all recipients.
	
2003-09-10  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: Bumped version to 1.1.8.

	* dns.cl:  Removed useful-dns-query function.  Its functionality
	is now provided by dns-query in acldns patch 5 (which is now
	required to build maild).
	
	* misc source files:  Changed all calls to useful-dns-query to
	dns-query w/ :search t keyword arg.

2003-09-05  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: Bumped version to 1.1.7

	* dns.cl:  New file containing dns-related stuff that used to be
	in utils.cl.  Fixed useful-dns-query so that it doesn't do
	repeated calls to configure-dns.

2003-09-02  root  <root@dancy>

	* version.cl: Bumped version to 1.1.6
	
	* smtp-server-checkers.cl: In sender domain checker, when
	complaining about a resolution problem, include the domain in
	question.

	* smtp-server.cl: Tell queue-finalize to add a Date header to
	received messages if they don't have one already.  

2003-08-22  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: Bumped version to 1.1.5.

	* rewrite.cl: Cope better with invalid email addresses that may be
	found in mail headers during rewrite.  

2003-08-19  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: Bumped version to 1.1.4.

	* emailaddr.cl:  Allow carriage return characters to be treated as
	whitespace even though it's not allowed in the RFC.  This helps
	deal w/ bogus mail headers that spammers create sometimes.

2003-08-15  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* version.cl: Bumped version to 1.1.3.

	* config.cl: Changed text name of smtp-mail-from-domain-checker to
	"Sender domain must resolve checker" (easier to understand in the
	statistics web page this way).

	* utils.cl:  Removed domain-exists-p and added dns-record-exists-p
	and valid-email-domain-p.  These new functions are more exacting
	in their answers... and dns-record-exists-p is a bit more general
	than the old domain-exists-p.  valid-email-domain-p has follows a
	more specific definition of what it means for an email domain to
	exist (see the code for details).

	* smtp-server-checkers.cl:  In smtp-mail-from-domain-checker, use
	valid-email-domain-p instead of domain-exists-p.  Update the
	response message as well.

	In the reverse DNS checker, use dns-record-exists-p instead of
	domain-exists-p.

2003-08-04  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Added relaying-allowed-p utility function.  Use it in
	smtp-conneciton-reverse-dns-checker to make an exception for
	allowable relay clients.

	* Bumped version to 1.1.2.

	* greylist.cl: Added *greylist-ip-whitelist* configuration
	parameter which specifies a list of IP addresses or networks to
	skip greylisting for.  Evan Harris maintains a list in his
	greylist cvs module.  I may do another update which can read his
	file directly.. perhaps at runtime.

2003-07-30  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* Bumped version to 1.1.1

	* headers.cl:  Added a big list (stolen from sendmail) of
	potential sender and receiver headers that may need to be
	rewritten.  

2003-07-23  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Bumped version to 1.1.0

	* Greylisting now works in two modes (controlled by
	*greylist-operation-mode*).  Default is :opt-out.  In :opt-out
	mode the optout table is queried to see if the recipient doesn't
	want greylisting, otherwise greylisting will occur.  In :opt-in
	mode, no greylisting occurs unless there's an entry in the optin
	table.  See updated greylist.sql for statements to create the new
	tables and indexes.  The tables need to be there even if you're
	not taking advantage of them.

	* queue-process.cl:  Print "/var/spool/maild is empty" during
	(queue-list) if the queue dir is empty.

	* smtp-server.cl:  Wrap call to update-smtp-stats w/ ignore-errors.
	

2003-07-23  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>
1.0.1

	* smtp-server.cl: final *helo-must-match-ip* changes, which really
	  only have an effect if the value is `t'.

2003-07-23  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>
1.0

	* Dubbed this version 1.0 and updated several places to include
	the version number.

	* Added check-mail-virus program.  

	* Fixed message data checker statistic updater.

	* SMTP delivery:  Now uses a single SMTP session for delivery of a
	message for recipients at the particular domain.  I had avoided
	adding this complexity but it was necessary to avoid recipients
	getting multiple copies of a message.   [Lotsa new code here
	<scary noises>]

	* Program alias delivery: Removed requirement that programs use on
	the right-hand side of aliases must be owned by root.  That's too
	restrictive.

	* Added a consistent syslog entry when a mail is received from any
	source (SMTP or stdin).  Message ID is included to help tracking a
	message.  


2003-07-22  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* greylist.cl: *greylist-db-host* variable for specifying the
	mysql host.  Default is "localhost".  Useful for shared database.
	Also, use "lock tables..." when updating a triple to avoid
	concurrency problems.
	
2003-07-21  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* greylist.cl:  From Evan Harris' latest greylist announcement:

	" - Discovered postfix normally uses <postmaster@some.domain> for
	its envelope from address when doing SMTP callbacks.  Changed
	milter to treat any email from postmaster@ as a callback and delay
	the tempfail until after the DATA phase."

	Made the corresponding change in maild.  

2003-07-09  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Don't do HELO domain check if connection is from localhost.

	* SMTP server statistics are stored in a file so they can be read
	back in during future server restarts.

2003-07-08  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* smtp-server.cl:
	- small bug fix to format call
	- have a non-nil and non-t value of *helo-must-match-ip* means
	  just log, don't really reject (unless problems resolving the
	  domain are found) the connection.  It's useful for seeing what
	  would happen if you set the variable to `t'.
	* config.cl: doc changes to *helo-must-match-ip*
	...add CVS Id to all .cl files

2003-07-08  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	*honors -m and -oM options so the sender will get a copy of mail
	sent to mailing lists if the sender is a member of those lists.

2003-07-03  root  <root@dancy>

	* smtp-server.cl/config.cl: Added option *helo-must-match-ip*
	which requires that clients use the HELO command... and that the
	domain specified in the HELO command must resolve to the IP
	address of the connecting client.

2003-07-02  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* smtp-server.cl: Collects some statistics during operation now.

	* www.cl: New file.  Optional web interface for viewing stats.
	Added (enable-webserver) to your maild.cl to use.  Default port is
	localhost:2525.  Use keyword arts :port and :interface to
	override.

2003-07-02  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* config.cl,
	* smtp-server-checkers.cl: added *dns-blacklist-failure-response*
	  and *dns-blacklist-temp-failure-response*.  See comments in
	  config.cl for more info.

2003-07-02  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Added new *dns-blacklist-recipient-exceptions* parameter for
	specifying recipients that should not be subject to DNS
	blacklisting.  

2003-07-01  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* maild.cl: Allow alternate config file to be specified.  Must be
	running as root to do this.

	* smtp-server*.cl: Added hook for initial connection checkers.
	Moved the regular blacklisting stuff into a checker.

	Added option *reverse-dns-required* to insist that a connecting
	client has a reverse DNS record.

2003-06-30  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* input.cl:  When reading a message in, strip the Unix mailbox
	"From " separator if there is one. 

2003-06-29  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Many changes to allow for mailer definitions.  

	Incompatible changes: The arguments to the local delivery program
	command line building function are different now.  Check your
	configuration files.  The first argument is a parsed emailaddr
	struct... the second argument is the queue struct.

	*local-recip-checks*, *local-delivey-user*, and
	*deliver-local-command* variables have been removed.  They are
	part of a mailer definition now.

	* MAILERS.txt: new file describing how to use mailer definitions.

	* Improved handling of wildcard aliases.

	* Bounces show alias expansions to help diagnose problems in aliases.

	* Additional relaying-allowed checkers can be specified now.  See
	config.cl for details.

	* greylist.cl:  Added reconnect code in case mysql was restarted
	or something.   Also, hosts that are allowed to relay (as
	determined by calling the new relay checkers) aren't subject to
	greylisting now.

2003-06-27  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* Fix header rewrite after changes mentioned below (wasn't really
	happening).

2003-06-26  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* headers.cl/rewrite.cl: rewrite-headers now properly deals with
	headers that span multiple lines.

	* maild.cl:  Do 'maild -bp' if executed as 'mailq'.

2003-06-25  Kevin Layer  <layer@relay.known.net>

	* Makefile: fix install's chown; parameterize `lisp'; cp -p on
	  init script

2003-06-25  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Changed the DNS blacklisting to a rcpt-to checker so that sender
	and recipient can be logged.

	* Makefile:  chown installed files to 'root'

	* Update greylist.sql for faster setup.

	* Added greylisting feature.

	* Added rc script for redhat-style hosts.

	* Added DNS-based blacklisting.

	* Added in hooks so that administrators can easily add checks
	during the MAIL FROM and RCPT TO and DATA phases of an SMTP
	session.  The greylisting code uses these.

	* Moved some of the built-in checks that the smtp server did
	during the mail from, rcpt to and data phases into
	smtp-server-checkers.cl.  They use the newly created hooks.

2003-06-23  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* utils.cl:  Make short-host-name really return a short host name.

	* config.cl:  Removed franz-specific stuff.

2003-06-18  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Makefile:  Added 'install' rule.

	* deliver.cl:  Downcase local recipient name.

	* load.cl: Don't do the sendmail.dxl and sendmail.lic symlinks
	anymore.  Not necessary w/ new patches.

2003-06-18  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* maild.cl: Make use of updated with-command-line-arguments
	patches.  Process -oi option... ignores other unrecognized
	options.  Ignores -bi command line arg.

2003-06-08  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* deliver.cl: Add the "From " separator to messages being
	delivered to programs and to files.

	* aliases.cl:  Supports wildcard aliases now.

	* checkers.cl:  Added support for external checker programs.

	* config.cl:  Removed *virtusersfile*.  Not used anymore.  Added
	*external-checker-user* variable for specifying user under which
	external checkers run.

	* deliver-smtp.cl:  Fixed check for nxdomain.

	* deliver.cl:  When delivering to program alias, use
	*program-alias-user*, not *local-delivery-user*.

	* recips.cl:  Fixed buglet.

	* virtusers.cl:  Removed.   Implemented in aliases.

2003-06-06  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* config.cl:  New parameter.  *extra-headers-func* for specifying
	the a function that will be called to add additional message
	headers when a queue item is being finalized.

	* emailaddr.cl:  Added unquote-quoted-string.

	* headers.cl:  Don't add the envelope recipient list to the
	Received header.  

	* load.cl:  Added break-on-warnings.

	* queue.cl: Added queue-append-header, queue-replace-header, and
	queue-locate-header convenience functions (intended for use in an
	*extra-headers-func*).
	
	* utils.cl: removed unquote-quoted-string.
	
2003-05-19  root  <root@dancy>

	* config.cl:  Parameterized the blacklisted host message in a new
	*blacklisted-response* variable.  Added a new *maximum-hop-count*
	parameter as well.   Changed *smtp-data-checkers* to
	*message-data-checkers* since they are used during stdin reciption
	and smtp reception.  The default list of checkers is the size
	check and the max hop count check.

	* checkers.cl:  New.  Has hop count and message size checkers.

	* headers.cl:  New count-received-headers function.

	* input.cl:  Run message checks before accepting a message.  Error
	out if we get back reject or transient status.

	* load.cl:  Added "checkers" to the file list.

	* smtp-server.cl:  Use parameterized blacklisted client text now.
	Moved out message checking stuff into check-message-checkers in
	checkers.cl.  


2003-05-16  root  <root@dancy>

	* aliasees.cl:  Always copy recip structs before returning them
	from alias expansions.

	* emailaddr.cl:  Removed parse-email-addr-list.  It has been
	replaced by parse-recip-list in recips.cl   Turned a few parsed
	things into structs for easier manipulation.  Added collect-cfws
	utility function.  Improved "group" mailbox parsing.

	* queue-process.cl:  The list of all queue ids is now sorted
	before being returned.    queue-list:  Print recipient status
	information.  

	* recips.cl:  Rewrote the parse-recip-list stuff again so that it
	can handle group mailboxes but still be flexible when bad
	addresses are encountered during parsing.

	* rewrite.cl:  Fixed up the header rewrite stuff to correspond w/
	the changes in emailaddr.cl

	

2003-05-15  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* aliases.cl:  Make sure that only one thread reparses the aliases
	file.   Removed a bunch of stuff that became redundant with the
	new recips code.

	* emailaddr.cl:  Added some extra utility functions (for use in
	recips.cl, mainly).

	* input.cl:  send-from-smtp:  Accept emailaddr or recip struct
	type recips.   use new get-good-recips-from-string function in
	grab-recips-from-headers.  

	* load.cl:  Load recips.cl before aliases.cl.

	* maild.cl:  Added -bv mode for testing address parsing.
	Simplified command line recipient processing by using new
	get-good-recips-from-string function.

	* queue.cl:  queue-finalize:  Accept emailaddr or recip type
	recips.

	* recips.cl:  Added 'orig' slot to recip struct for recording the
	string that was originally parsed.    get-recipient-disposition
	accepts emailaddr or recip struct arg now.   Improved address list
	parsing.  

2003-05-14  Ahmon Dancy  <dancy@dancy>

	* queue.cl:  In queue-finalize, call expand-addresses w/ the queue
	sender so that the address can be removed from mailing lists.

	* recips.cl:  expand-addresses changed so that the message sender
	will be removed from mailing list expansions.  Also fixed up
	same-recip-p.  It behaves in a more sendmail-like way now.


2003-05-12  root  <root@dancy>

	* deliver.cl:  Use new recip struct. 

	* headers.cl:  Removed replace-header function.  It was unsafe
	because it would replace too much if there were multiple headers
	of the same type (for example, two To: headers).  Added
	recip-header-p and sender-header-p utility functions.  

	* input.cl:  Fixed grab-recips-from-headers function so that it
	works for multiple instances of the same header type..

	* queue-process.cl:  Additional recip struct fixes.

	* recips.cl:  Added recip-printable utility function.  

	* rewrite.cl:  Fixed the rewrite-headers function so that it works
	for multiple instances of the same header type.


2003-05-12  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* aliases.cl:  Only allow one :error: thing on a right hand side
	of an alias.

	* bounce.cl:  Change the name of the bounce function to 'bounce'.
	Added stuff so that bounces are sent to their proper owners.  Also
	added an additional keyword argument to the bounce function so
	that undeliverable recipients (due to timeout) will have a
	sentence indicating so.

	* config.cl:  Moved the aliases lookup in front of the passwd
	lookup in the *local-recip-checks* parameter.  

	* deliver-smtp.cl:  Uses new recip struct. 

	* emailaddr.cl:  Make sure that the emailaddr-orig for <> is "<>".

	* queue-process.cl:  queue-process-single-help uses the new recip
	struct now.  The function is a smidge simpler now.

	* recips.cl:  Added a 'status' slot to the recip struct.  
	lookup-recip-in-passwd now returns a recip struct.

	get-content-disposition modified since the lookup-recip-in-*
	functions return recip structs now.  expand-recips is now
	expand-addresses.  
	

2003-05-09  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* emailaddr.cl:  In parse-email-addr-list.  If cruft is all
	whitespace, then convert it to "".  Also, emailaddr-orig is now
	set to just the user@domain string.  No comments or other stuff is
	included.  

	* headers.cl:  Fixed bug in make-from-header when 'from' is <>.  

	* input.cl:  New function:  grab-recips-from-headers for use w/
	the -t flag.  send-from-stdin now uses this function if it is
	called w/ grab-recips keyword argument.  

	* maild.cl:  Added -t support.

	* queue-process.cl:  Delivery failure messages for a particular
	queue item are collected and sent in a single bounce message now.

	* queue.cl:  make-queue-file doesn't take the recips list now.
	That is saved for the new queue-finalize function (which is mostly
	queue-init-headers renamed).   Updated the with-new-queue macro
	for this as well.

	* several places:  Changes due to the changes in queue.cl.

2003-05-08  root  <root@dancy>

	* aliases.cl:  Aliases file must be owned by root and have safe
	permissions.

	* deliver.cl:  Delivery programs (aliases and defined local
	delivery program) must be owned by root and have safe
	permissions.  I may relax this if it turns out to be too
	restrictive.

	* headers.cl:  Received header now includes the original envelope
	recipients per Charley's request.  Note that this makes Bcc:
	ineffective (in terms of blindness).

	* lock.cl:  Generalized with-lock-file-nowait to with-lock-file
	and a keyword arg.

	* maild.cl:  /etc/maild/cl must be owned by root and have safe
	permissions.  Same w/ *queuedir*.

	* queue.cl:  Queue files are generated in a different way now.
	Simpler.

	* recips.cl:  Moved some of the recipient alias expansion stuff
	out of queue.cl and into this file.   Fixed a bug w/ "user:
	user@localdomain" type expansion.

2003-04-30  root  <root@gills.dancysoft.com>

	* Makefile:  Make maild/maild depend on *.cl

	* bounce.cl: Use new with-new-queue macro.

	* deliver.cl:  Add verbosity to deliver-local function.  In
	send-message-to-program, return stderr along w/ the :transient
	error code if the delivery program exited w/ non-zero
	status... and do the same for the error condition from the message
	stream writer.

	* input.cl:  Had a call to string-downcase in the wrong place.
	Moved.    Updated send-from-stdin.  read-message-stream now calls
	finish-output and fsync on the datafile on behalf of the caller.

	* queue.cl:  Updated with-new-queue macro.

	* smtp-server.cl:  Updated to use with-new-queue macro.  

2003-04-30  root  <root@dancy>

	* deliver.cl:  write-message-to-stream:  headers that spanned
	lines weren't being written out w/ the proper EOL convention.
	Fixed.  

	* queue-process.cl: Rearranged some code in the queue processing
	function for better status reporting.    Minor changes to the
	queue lister.  Added a queue processing daemon.

	* queue.cl:  Added new 'valid' slot to the queue struct.  It is
	used by the new with-new-queue macro.  If the slot is still nil
	when the macro completes, the queue file will be deleted.  This
	effects cleanup for interrupted message transmissions, etc.

	* security.cl:  verify-root: new function to check that the real
	user is root.
	
	* input.cl: send-from-stdin:  Try out new with-new-queue macro.

	* maild.cl: main:  Implemented more of the command line args.  Can
	run in daemon mode now w/ optional periodic queue processing.
	Signal handlers added for SIGINT and SIGTERM for clean shutdown.
	Security checks on queue-manipulating commands.  

	* smtp-server.cl:  New smtp-server-daemon function.

2003-04-28  root  <root@dancy>

	* config.cl: Added *smtp-ip* parameter for binding the server
	socket to a particular interface.

	* smtp-server.cl:  Use the new *smtp-ip* parameter

	* deliver-smtp.cl:  Added :verbose keyword arg to many of the
	functions so that the SMTP transaction can be watched (ala
	sendmail -v).   Also added a with-socket-timeout around the main
	function so that an unresponsive SMTP server doesn't make us hang.

	* deliver.cl:  New write-message-to-stream-async for use with
	send-message-to-program.  It is intended to be called via
	mp:process-run-function.  It takes a structure which has the usual
	arguments to write-message-to-stream.. plus a gate and a status
	field for returning information to the caller.

	* queue-process.cl:  Added :verbose keyword stuff.  Also, the
	queue processor now collects the error messages from the delivery
	subroutines for storage in the queue file.  

2003-04-24  root  <root@dancy>

	* config.cl:  Call local delivery program w/ -f.
	Added comments to the timeouts section.

	* sockets are now hiper sockets so that I can use read and write
	timeouts w/ ease.

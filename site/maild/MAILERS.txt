*** Notes about the *mailers* configuration variable:

The *mailers* variable holds a list of mailers.  

Each entry is a list of the following values.

1) keyword identifier
2) descriptive string
3) symbol naming function to call to look up a recipient for this
   mailer type
4) symbol naming function to call to generate the command line
   for the delivery program.
5) string indicating the user under which the delivery program
   should run (the user's normal group and extra groups are 
   used as well)

Entries are processed in order (by calling lookup-recip-in-passwd)
until one of them accepts the recipient.

All potential recipients are transformed via aliases first.

*** The lookup function

The function is called with argument which is either a string or
parsed email address struct [Use make-parsed-and-unparsed-address
function for easy handling of either type].  The function should
return nil if it doesn't deal w/ this recip, non-nil if it does.


*** The delivery program command line function

The function is called with two arguments:
1) The recipient struct
2) The 'queue' object.

The function should return a list which represents the components of
the command line to be executed.

Default: use the built-in local delivery command which creates:
procmail -Y -a <extension> -f <envelope-from> -d <user>

 
*** Relation to the aliases file

All email addresses are passed through the aliases file for
transformation before being used to find the appropriate mailer.

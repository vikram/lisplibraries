- untill now everything was tested on Unbuntu Linux 5.10
  with Berkley DB 4.3

LISP IMPLEMENTATIONS
=============
if you test with another lisp implementation or system
please tell me if it runs or not (fixing the problems will be fine too).
These are the systems i tried to use bdb (on a x86 Linux system with libdb4.3)

- sbcl (successfully tested with sbcl 0.9.10 and newer on x86 , 
        didn't tried older versions)
- cmucl (successfully tested with release-19a)
- clisp (successfully tested with version 2.38)

INSTALLATION
============
1. cd into "lib" directory
2. edit installation path in Makefile
3. "make" and "make install"
4. use ldconfig ...
5. update src/packages.lisp to the libary path

The library may be loaded using asdf now
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :bdb)

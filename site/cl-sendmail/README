cl-sendmail is a hack of Christophe Rhodes' sendmail.lisp file found
at
http://www-jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~csr21/lisp/sendmail.lisp

It currently only runs on SBCL and depends on the software found at
these locations:
http://files.b9.com/cl-base64/cl-base64-latest.tar.gz
http://www.bobturf.org/software/cl-mime/
http://common-lisp.net/project/xmls/
http://www.bobturf.org/software/xmls-tools/


Note, versions prior to 0.2.1 used Juri Pakaste's
base64.lisp. Versions 0.2.1 and after use Kevin Rosenberg's cl-base64
library.

* Quick (or quasi-quick) start for a UnCommon Web (and Lisp) newbie
* (release 0.6 - 19-Mar-2006)

** Abstract

This document describes how to configure a new application in the
UnCommon Web framework (UCW), using different backends (internal,
portableaserve, apache) as web server. This document is NOT an
introduction to Lisp language and is NOT a tutorial to UnCommon Web. 

** Introduction

The author of UnCommon Web (UCW) is Marco Baringer.
The homepage of UCW is http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/.

You can download UCW from ftp://ftp.common-lisp.net/pub/project/ucw.

There are two movies (sic!) introducing Slime and UCW:

    http://common-lisp.net/torrents/slime.torrent (~150Mb/~60mins)
    http://common-lisp.net/torrents/hello-world.torrent (~50Mb/~20mins)

You need a Lisp implementation and an interface development environment.
I use OpenMCL 1.0, GNU Emacs and Slime on Mac OS X with Tiger 10.4.3.

    OpenMCL         http://openmcl.clozure.com/
    Emacs Homepage  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html
    Emacs for Mac   http://bluebeard.org/software/emacs_osx/
    Slime           http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/

Please, before to start the UCW adventure, you have to have a Lisp
environment working: I mean, when you are in Emacs, pressing 'M-x
slime', it displays the REPL (Read Eval Prompt Loop) window. A good
introduction about Slime and Emacs is the Baringer's movie. 

** Installation

UCW is a framework to build web appllications. You know, we have to
choice where to install UCW, where to install the library UCW depends
on, where to install our applications and where to put the links
referencing the subsystems of UCW. Of course, you can choice whatever
path, but my installation is the following:

      UCW directory 	  ~/My/Dev/Lisp/ucw_dev
      UCW libraries	  ~/My/Dev/Lisp/ucw_lib
      UCW applications	  ~/My/Dev/Lisp/ucw_apps
      ASDF registry       ~/My/Dev/lisp/zsystems

To download the UCW development branch, you can go in a directory, for
instance ~/My/Dev/Lisp, :

    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/bese/repos/ucw_dev/

The ucw_dev directory is created. Again, you can install UCW wherever
you like. I name that directory as UCW_HOME.

** Read the README

First, read the README you find in UCW_HOME directory.

*** Dependencies

In 'Dependencies' paragraph you read UCW depends on a number of external
libraries:

- arnesi
- yaclml
- parenscript
- iterate
- rfc2388
- rfc2109
- slime
- cl-ppcre
- split-sequence
- trivial-sockets
- puri
- net-telent-date


You can configure a lot of web server backend: allegroserve or
portableaserve, araneida, apache. There is an internal web server too.

*** ASDF

Reading the 'Setting up ASDF' paragraph in README file, you learn about
Another System Definition Facility (ASDF). ASDF is included in
OpenMCL. For instance, you can try to eval (require :asdf) in REPL to
verify the existence of the package in your Lisp environment.

You can load ASDF automatically, starting Lisp implementation, using the
proper init Lisp file. For OpenMCL init file is 'openmcl-init.lisp'.
You can create it in the HOME directory, the user home directory, and
write the following lines:

(require :asdf)

(push "/Users/albertosantini/My/Dev/Lisp/zsystems/"
       asdf:*central-registry*)

Well, you are informing UCW, using ASDF facility, where the dependencies
are. The path of the central registry directory and the use of absolute
or relative symlinks, it's a matter of taste.

*** Slime

Is Slime configured, isn't? Remember to download it by CVS, because the
snapshot doesn't contain the 'swank.asd' file, needed in the UCW
configuration. 

** Download the libraries

- arnesi            ucw repository
- yacml             ucw repository
- parentscript      ucw repository
- iterate           http://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/releases/
- portableaserve    http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableaserve/

drwxr-xr-x    9 albertos  albertos   306 Mar 19 09:55 yaclml
    
** Configure UCW server

The default backend, the web server, configured in UCW is an internal
web server: httpd. You can use mod-lisp, araneida and aserve.

(ucw:create-server :backend :httpd
                         ;; :mod-lisp
                         ;; :araneida
                         ;; :aserve
...

Now you can add in the central registry directory all the symlinks to
the library downloaded. You have to add the others with the command
'ln'. For instance, if you are in the 'zsystems' directory:
   
    ln -s ~/My/Dev/Lisp/ucw_libs/portableaserve/aserve/aserve.asd aserve.asd

When you add all the symlinks, in the 'zsystems' directory you
find the following symlinks:

acl-compat.asd -> ... ucw_libs/portableaserve/acl-compat/acl-compat.asd
arnesi.asd -> ... ucw_libs/arnesi_dev/arnesi.asd
aserve.asd -> ... ucw_libs/portableaserve/aserve/aserve.asd
cl-ppcre.asd -> ... ucw_libs/cl-ppcre-1.2.12/cl-ppcre.asd
hello.asd -> ... ucw_apps/hello/hello.asd
htmlgen.asd -> ... ucw_libs/portableaserve/aserve/htmlgen/htmlgen.asd
iterate.asd -> ... ucw_libs/iterate_1.4/iterate.asd
parenscript.asd -> ... ucw_libs/parenscript/parenscript.asd
puri.asd -> ... ucw_libs/puri-1.3.1.3/puri.asd
rfc2109.asd -> ... ucw_libs/rfc2109/rfc2109.asd
rfc2388.asd -> ... ucw_libs/rfc2388/rfc2388.asd
swank.asd -> ~/.emacs.d/slime/swank.asd
split-sequence -> ... ucw_libs/split-sequence/split-sequence.asd
trivial-sockets -> ... ucw_libs/trivial-sockets/trivial-sockets.asd
ucw.asd -> ... ucw_dev/ucw.asd
ucw-presentations -> ... ucw_libs/ucw-presentations/ucw-presentations.asd
yaclml.asd -> ... ucw_libs/yaclml/yaclml.asd

These symlinks link the web apps, hello, and the backend portableaserve,
aserve.

** Start UCW server

Now you can start the UCW server from the UCW_HOME directory with the
command: 

    ~/My/Apps/ccl/dppccl -l bin/start.lisp

'dppccl' is the command line REPL of OpenMCL. Verify if there is a
variable CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY set to ~/My/Apps/ccl directory, the
installation directory of OpenMCL. You can set that variable in
~/.profile. You can use the 'openmcl' script in ~/My/Apps/ccl/scripts
directory. If you start UCW server from a shell inside Emacs, you have
to set again the environment variable CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY: 

    (setenv "CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY" "/Users/albertosantini/My/Apps/ccl")

Please remember to modify the path of CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY.

** Test UCW server

The server is started and you see the welcome message of OpenMCL.

To test the UCW server you can use the url:

  http://localhost:8080/
or
  http://localhost:8080/index.ucw

The port 8080 is the default port for the web server backend. You can
find the details of the configuration at the end of the file
'start.lisp' when the server is created. We are using the internal web
server. 

If the server is up and running you can see the UCW Examples page with
the counter, component transaction, form demo, presentations,
etc. examples. 

*** Portableaserve backend

If you want to use portableaserve, you can change 'httpd' with
'aserve' in the fiel 'start.lisp'.

A note for the portableaserve backend: it doesn't support regular
expression entry point. You can change the file 'examples.lisp'
in UCW_HOME/examples from

  (:entry-point "^(|index.ucw)$" (:application *example-application*
to
  (:entry-point "index.ucw" (:application *example-application*

*** Apache backend

If you like to use Apache 2 backend, first you have to have a Apache web
server up and runnnig; then you have to add the mod-lisp module by Marc
Battyani you find at

    http://www.fractalconcept.com/asp/html/mod_lisp.html

You can add the module, after you downloaded it, using the command
    
    apxs2 -i -a -c mod_lisp2.c

Then cp ucw/etc/ucw-examples.apache2 to /etc/apache2/sites-available/ucw-examples
and ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/ucw-examples /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-ucw-examples

Remember to change the port 8080 to 3000 and the backend type in the file
'ucw/etc/start.lisp', allowing the connection between the module mod_lisp and UCW.

** Write Hello application

Now you can write a new (and simple) application, the classical 'Hello, 
World!'. Make a sub-directory 'hello' in the directory
'ucw_apps'. I name the directory '~/My/Dev/Lisp/ucw_apps/hello' as
HELLO_HOME. Of course, you can use another path. Copy the following code
in a file 'hello.lisp' and save it in HELLO_HOME.

-------- cut --------
(in-package :it.bese.ucw-user)

(defvar *hello-world*
  (make-instance 'cookie-session-application :url-prefix "/hello/"))

(register-application *default-server* *hello-world*)

(defentry-point "index.ucw" (:application *hello-world*) ()
  (loop
     (let ((name (call 'hello-world-home-page)))
       (call 'personalized-greeting :name name))))

(defcomponent hello-world-home-page (simple-window-component)
  ()
  (:default-initargs :title "Hello, World!"))

(defmethod render ((hello hello-world-home-page))
  (<:p "Hello, World!")
  (let ((name ""))
    (<ucw:form
     :action (ok hello name)
     (<ucw:input :type "text" :accessor name)
     (<:submit))))

(defcomponent personalized-greeting (simple-window-component)
  ((name :accessor name :initarg :name))
  (:default-initargs :title "Greetings!"))

(defmethod render ((greeting personalized-greeting))
  (<:p "Hi, " (<:as-html (name greeting)) ", how are you?")
  (<ucw:a :action (ok greeting) "Done."))
-------- cut --------

** Configure Hello application

To configure an application in the UCW framework, it's better to know
something about ASDF. You can read the manual at the url:

  http://constantly.at/lisp/asdf/

In the directory HELLO_HOME you have to create the file 'hello.asd',
copying the following code:

-------- cut --------
;; -*- lisp -*-

(defsystem :hello
  :components ((:file "hello")))
-------- cut --------

Then add a symlink in 'zsystems' to the file 'hello.asd' and
add a line at the end of the file 'start.lisp' in UCW_HOME/bin:

-------- cut --------
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :hello) ;; load hello application
-------- cut --------

Quit UCW server and restart. Now UCW server load the Hello application,
from the HELLO_HOME directory, reading 'hello.lisp' file.

** Test Hello application

To test the Hello application you go to the url

    http://localhost:8080/hello/index.ucw

and the "Hello, World!" is there, I hope.

** Conclusions

Of course, this document is not exaustive about the UCW
configuration. The audience target is the people with very little
experience of Lisp, downloading for the first time UCW and asking "Well,
and now?". UCW is a wonderful and powerful framework.

** Getting help

You can get help on IRC too. You can use ERC, an IRC implementation for
Emacs. You can download it at the url

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/erc/

And you can find help at the url

    http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsIRCClient 

You can join to the channel #ucw or #lisp on irc.freenode.net server.

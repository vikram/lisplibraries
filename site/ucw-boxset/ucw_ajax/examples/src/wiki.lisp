;;;; * Introduction

;;;; This tutorial will show you how to create web applications with
;;;; UnCommon Web (UCW).  During this tutorial we will create two
;;;; distinct, but functionaly similar, wikis.  The first, "regular
;;;; style," will be developed using the same mind set and
;;;; organization as you would use with any other web framework
;;;; (though it will use as much of UCW as possible).  The second
;;;; wiki, "UCW style," will be an idiomatic UCW application.

;;;; We've named the urls and classes in such a fashion that the two
;;;; interfaces can coexist within the same image. You can try jumping
;;;; back and forth between the two styles and compare how they act.

;;;; ** Getting Started

;;;; At some point we may add minimal installation instructions here,
;;;; until then we'll just assume that you've already downloaded,
;;;; built and setup ucw.

;;;; To load the wiki just load this file after you've started
;;;; UCW. This wiki depends on cl-ppcre and the ucw example
;;;; application.

;;;; * The wiki backend

;;;; Both of our wikis will have very similar functionality: we will
;;;; allow users to view and edit pages; when viewing a page words
;;;; written in StudlyCaps will be converted into hyperlinks to like
;;;; named wiki pages; pages will be editable by anyone at any time;
;;;; every change will record the name of the author and a brief
;;;; summary of the changes.

;;;; We won't worry about "RecentChanges" or search functionality
;;;; (though this may be added later).

(defvar *wiki* (make-hash-table :test 'equal))

(defun find-wiki-page (page-name)
  (gethash page-name *wiki*))

(defun (setf find-wiki-page) (page page-name)
  (setf (gethash page-name *wiki*) page))

(defclass wiki-page ()
  ((page-name :accessor page-name :initarg :page-name)
   (contents  :accessor contents  :initarg :contents :initform "")))

(defmacro defwiki-page (name body)
  (rebinding (name)
    `(setf (find-wiki-page ,name)
           (make-instance 'wiki-page
                          :page-name ,name
                          :contents ,body))))

;;;; Both of the wikis use "WelcomePage" as the default page name, by
;;;; creating the page here we simplify some of the control flow.

(defwiki-page "WelcomePage"
  "Welcome to the wiki.")

(defclass wiki-edit ()
  ((author :accessor author :initarg :author :initform nil)
   (summary :accessor summary :initarg :summary :initform nil)
   (contents :accessor contents :initarg :contents))
  (:documentation "An object representing a single change to a
  single wiki page."))

(defun update-wiki-page (page-name change)
  (symbol-macrolet ((page (find-wiki-page page-name)))
    (unless page
      (setf page (make-instance 'wiki-page :page-name page-name)))
    (setf (contents page) (contents change))
    page))

;;;; * Regular Style

;;;; ** view.ucw

;;;; The view.ucw page is used for viewing the contents of a wiki
;;;; page. The user specifies which page they're insterested in using
;;;; the "page-name" HTTP request parameter. If no page-name is
;;;; specified we default to "WelcomePage," if the specified page-name
;;;; does not exist we assume the user wants to edit (in this case
;;;; create) the page.

;;;; *** view.ucw - Introducing defentry-point

(defentry-point "view.ucw" (:application *example-application*)
    ((page-name "WelcomePage"))
  (if (find-wiki-page page-name)
      (call 'view-wiki-page :page-name page-name)
      (call 'redirect-component
            :target (strcat "edit.ucw?page-name=" page-name))))

;;;; DEFENTRY-POINT is UCW's way of associating a piece of code to a
;;;; particular url, it's analogous to handlers or servlet definitions
;;;; in other frameworks.

;;;; In this case we are creating an entry-point named "view.ucw" and
;;;; tying it to the example-app application. The entry-point takes
;;;; one parameter: page-name. If the page-name parameter is not
;;;; passed in the request we will use "WelcomePage."

;;;; This entry-point is very simple, if the requested wiki-page
;;;; exists then we should just view it using the page (aka component)
;;;; view-wiki-page, if the requested page doesn't exist then we'll
;;;; just pretend that the user actually wants to edit the page.

;;;; What is the "effective" url for this entry point? Since
;;;; example-app application's url-prefix is "/ucw/examples/" we
;;;; simply concatentate the entry-point's name and the url-prefix to
;;;; get "/ucw/examples/view.ucw". The extension needn't be ".ucw" it
;;;; can be anything you want or nothing at all.  When using the
;;;; araneida or aserve backends the entry-point's url is
;;;; automatically registered with the server, with the mod_lisp
;;;; backend you must manually configure apache to send requests for
;;;; this entry point to ucw.

;;;; *** view-wiki-page - Introducing components

;;;; How do we tell UCW to show the user some html? While we could
;;;; just litter our entry-point with (progn (write-line "<html>")
;;;; ...) we're not going to, it's bad style and UCW is makes that
;;;; more difficult than it could be.

;;;; What we're supposed to do is hand off our request to a component
;;;; and let it deal with the nitty gritty html stuff. Here's the form
;;;; which defines the view-wiki-page component:

(defcomponent view-wiki-page (template-component)
  ((page-name :accessor page-name :initarg :page-name))
  (:default-initargs :template-name "wiki/view.tal"))

(defmethod template-component-environment nconc
    ((page view-wiki-page))
  (tal-env 'contents
           (cl-ppcre:regex-replace-all
            "([A-Z][a-z]+){2,}"
            (contents (find-wiki-page (page-name page)))
            "<a href=\"view.ucw?page-name=\\&\">\\&</a>")))

;;;; Notice how much the defcomponent macro looks like defclass,
;;;; that's not accidental. view-wiki-page now names a class of
;;;; components. The (call 'view-wiki-page ...) form in our view.ucw
;;;; entry-point is little more than a call to make-instance.

;;;; view-wiki-page, since it's a window-component, is designed to
;;;; occupy the entire browser window, it has to worry about emiting
;;;; <html> and <head> tags and setting up javascript includes and
;;;; style sheet links. Since view-wiki-page is also a template
;;;; component it depends an a TAL file ("wiki/view.tal") to
;;;; specify what html to output.

;;;; ** edit.ucw

;;;; *** The entry-point

;;;; Editing pages is only slightly more complicated than viewing:

(defentry-point "edit.ucw" (:application *example-application*)
  ((page-name "WelcomePage") name summary contents)
  (if contents
      (progn
        (update-wiki-page page-name (make-instance 'wiki-edit
                                                   :author name
                                                   :summary summary
                                                   :contents contents))
        (call 'thankyou :page-name page-name))
      (show-window "wiki/edit.tal" 'page-name page-name)))

;;;; We assume that if the request contains the contents parameter
;;;; then we're submitting an edit, otherwise we're asking for the
;;;; edit page form. We've already seen DEFENTRY-POINT, entry-point
;;;; lambda lists and call, so we can jump directly to the
;;;; edit-wiki-page component:

;;;; *** The component

(defcomponent edit-wiki-page (template-component)
  ((page-name :accessor page-name :initarg :page-name))
  (:default-initargs :template-name "wiki/edit.tal"))

;;;; Like view-wiki-page this is also a window component based on a
;;;; TAL template.

;;;; ** The thankyou page

;;;; Just for fun we're going to use YACLML as opposed to TAL for the
;;;; thankyou component:

(defcomponent thankyou ()
  ((page-name :accessor page-name :initarg :page-name)))

(defmethod render ((page thankyou))
  (symbol-macrolet ((page-name (<:as-html (page-name page))))
    (<:html
      (<:head
        (<:title "Thank you for editing " page-name))
      (<:body
        (<:p "Thank you for editing " page-name)
        (<:a :href (strcat "view.ucw?page-name=" (page-name page))
          "View " page-name)))))

;;;; As you can see by the strcat UCW isn't well adapted to munging
;;;; strings into urls. [the situation is slightly better in tal pages
;;;; with tal expression language].

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;;; * UCW Style

;;;; UCW styled apps, unlike regular style apps, start with components
;;;; and actions. Only later do we tie components and actions to urls
;;;; and pages.

;;;; ** wiki-manipulator

;;;; All of our wiki components are going to subclass
;;;; wiki-manipulator. This class provides the page-name slot and the
;;;; method on update-url.

(defcomponent wiki-manipulator ()
  ((page-name :accessor page-name
              :initarg :page-name
              :backtrack t)))

;;;; We define a method on update-url so that bookmarking this page,
;;;; or requesting it any time after the session has expired, will
;;;; view the current page (even if the user was editing it when he
;;;; created the bookmark). Note that there is nothing automatic about
;;;; this update-url method. It only works because we know that
;;;; wiki.ucw?page-name=Foo will show the page named Foo. Embedding
;;;; the wiki in another application would probably make this
;;;; assumption untrue and require a different update-url method.

(defmethod update-url ((component wiki-manipulator) url)
  (setf (ucw::uri.path url) "wiki.ucw")
  (push (cons "page-name" (page-name component)) (ucw::uri.query url))
  url)

;;;; ** wiki-viewer

;;;; The wiki-viewer component shows a page of the wiki. In particular
;;;; the component show the html version of the page named by the
;;;; value of the viewer's page-name slot. Unlike the wiki-editor
;;;; component a user will use the same wiki-viewer component during
;;;; the entire course of their browsing.

(defcomponent wiki-viewer (wiki-manipulator)
  ())

;;;; We split the text of the page into StudlyWords and non
;;;; StudlyWords. StudlyWords are wrapped in links to view-page
;;;; actions, everything else is sent as is to the client.

(defmethod render ((page wiki-viewer))
  (let ((scanner (cl-ppcre:create-scanner "((?:[A-Z][a-z]+){2,})")))
    (dolist (part (cl-ppcre:split scanner
                                  (contents (find-wiki-page (page-name page)))
                                  :with-registers-p t))
      (if (cl-ppcre:scan scanner part)
          (let ((part part))
            (<ucw:a :action-body (view-page page part)
              (<:as-html part)))
          (<:as-is part))))
  (<:p (<ucw:a :action-body (edit-page page (page-name page)) "Edit")))

;;;; *** The view-page action

(defaction view-page ((w wiki-viewer) page-name)
  (unless (find-wiki-page page-name)
    (edit-page w page-name))
  (setf (page-name w) page-name))

;;;; view-page simply changes the name of the current page in the
;;;; wiki-viewer (which is sufficent given how we've defined
;;;; view-page's render method). If the page doesn't already exist we
;;;; call the edit-page action.

;;;; *** edit-page - Introducing defaction

(defaction edit-page ((w wiki-viewer) page-name)
  (call 'wiki-editor :page-name page-name)
  (call 'wiki-editor-thankyou :page-name page-name))

;;;; This first calls a wiki-editor component, when that returns (by
;;;; calling answer) the action continues and we call the
;;;; wiki-editor-thankyou component.

;;;; Notice that while this action CALLs multiple components we do not
;;;; ANSWER. The view-page component basically sits in an infinite
;;;; loop, it shows various wiki pages and it calls out to various
;;;; other components, but the wiki-viewer itself will never
;;;; answer.

;;;; If we were to embed a wiki-viewer in other application we would
;;;; probably subclass wiki-viewer and change its render method to
;;;; produce a link which causes the component to answer.

;;;; ** wiki-editor

(defcomponent wiki-editor (wiki-manipulator)
  ())

;;;; This action, which is called from the edit form, updates the wiki
;;;; and then returns control to the calling component.

(defaction save-changes ((w wiki-editor) name summary contents)
  (update-wiki-page (page-name w)
                    (make-instance 'wiki-edit
                                   :author name
                                   :summary summary
                                   :contents contents))
  (answer (page-name w)))

(defmethod render ((w wiki-editor))
  (let ((name "")
        (summary "")
        (contents (if (find-wiki-page (page-name w))
                      (contents (find-wiki-page (page-name w)))
                      "")))
    (<ucw:form :action-body (save-changes w name summary contents)
               :method "POST"
      (<ucw:textarea :rows 15 :cols 80 :accessor contents)
      (<:p
        (<:label :for "author" "Name:")
        (<ucw:text :accessor name :id "author"))
      (<:p
        (<:label :for "summary" "Summary:")
        (<ucw:text :accessor summary :id "summary"))
      (<:p (<:input :type "submit" :value "Save Changes")))))

;;;; ** wiki-editor-thankyou

(defcomponent wiki-editor-thankyou (wiki-manipulator)
  ())

(defmethod render ((w wiki-editor-thankyou))
  (<:p "Thank you for editing " (<:as-html (page-name w)))
  (<ucw:a :action-body (ok w) "Ok."))

;;;; wiki-editor-thankyou uses the generic OK action. This action,
;;;; defined in UCW on all standard-components, simply calls answer.

;;;; ** wiki-window

;;;; The wiki components have been designed so that they can be
;;;; embeded in any other component. What this means is that our
;;;; trivial application needs some window component we can embed our
;;;; wiki components in:

(defcomponent wiki-app ()
  ((body :accessor body :component (wiki-viewer :page-name "WelcomePage"))
   (title :accessor title)))

(defmethod initialize-instance :after ((app wiki-app)
                                       &key (page-name "WelcomePage")
                                       &allow-other-keys)
  (setf (page-name (body app)) page-name))

(defmethod render ((w wiki-app))
  (when (subtypep (class-of (body w)) (find-class 'wiki-manipulator))
    (setf (title w) (page-name (body w))))
  (<:html
    (<:head
      (<:title (<:as-html (title w))))
    (<:body
      (<:h1 (<:as-html (title w)))
      (render (body w)))))

(defentry-point "wiki.ucw" (:application *example-application*)
    ((page-name "WelcomePage"))
  (call 'wiki-app :page-name page-name))

;;;; * Adding a Login Page

;;;; Let's pretend that, in order to avoid spurious spamming, we want
;;;; to make users login before editing pages.

;;;; NB: If you are comparing the two wiki implementations you need to
;;;; remeber that both interfaces use the same session object. Logging
;;;; in through the "regular style" wiki will couse you to be logged
;;;; into the "UCW style" wiki and vice versa.

;;;; ** Regular Style

;;;; *** Redefining edit.ucw

;;;; The only way to edit a page is to go through the edit.ucw, so
;;;; we'll put the login logic there. Every time a user attempts to
;;;; edit a page we look in the current session for something
;;;; (anything other than NIL will do) under the key USER. If we find
;;;; something then continue as before, if we don't we redirect to the
;;;; wiki-login.ucw page.

(defentry-point "edit.ucw" (:application *example-application*)
  ((page-name "WelcomePage") name summary contents)
  (cond
    ((not (get-session-value 'user))
     (call 'redirect-component :target "wiki-login.ucw"))
    (contents
     (update-wiki-page page-name
                       (make-instance 'wiki-edit
                                      :author name
                                      :summary summary
                                      :contents contents))
     (call 'thankyou :page-name page-name))
    (t
     (call 'edit-wiki-page :page-name page-name))))

;;;; *** New page wiki-login.ucw

;;;; wiki-login.ucw looks for two request parameters, username and
;;;; password. If they're found, and if they're both equal to "wiki"
;;;; then we put the username in the session table under the key USER
;;;; (so that the edit.ucw entry point will find it) and we redirect
;;;; to view.ucw. If the username and password parameters aren't
;;;; passed, or they're aren't equal to "wiki" then we show a
;;;; wiki-login-for-edit component.

(defentry-point "wiki-login.ucw" (:application *example-application*)
    ((username "") (password ""))
  (if (and (string= "wiki" username) (string= "wiki" password))
      (progn
        (setf (get-session-value 'user) username)
        (call 'redirect-component :target "view.ucw"))
      (call 'wiki-login-for-edit)))

;;;; This wiki-login-for-edit component simply creates a very minimal
;;;; page with a form for the username and password values.

(defcomponent wiki-login-for-edit ()
  ())

(defmethod render ((login wiki-login-for-edit))
  (<:html
   (<:head (<:title "Login"))
   (<:body
    (<:form :action "wiki-login.ucw"
      (<:p "Login with wiki/wiki")
      (<:p
        (<:label :for "username" "Username: ")
        (<:input :type "text" :name "username" :id "username"))
      (<:p
        (<:label :for "password" "Password: ")
        (<:input :type "text" :name "password" :id "password"))
      (<:p (<:submit :value "Login"))))))

;;;; ** UCW Style

;;;; *** Redefining the edit-page action

;;;; As with the regular style wiki we'll put the login checking just
;;;; before editing a page. If the the value of (get-session-value
;;;; 'user) is null than we call wiki-login component and store
;;;; whatever it answers in the session under the key user. When the
;;;; wiki-login component has finished (or when we're already logged
;;;; in) we simply continue as before by calling wiki-editor and
;;;; wiki-editor-thankyou.

(defaction edit-page ((w wiki-viewer) page-name)
  (unless (get-session-value 'user)
    (setf (get-session-value 'user) (call 'wiki-login)))
  (call 'wiki-editor          :page-name page-name)
  (call 'wiki-editor-thankyou :page-name page-name))

;;;; *** The wiki-login component and actions

;;;; (while we could use ucw's login component we're going to try to
;;;; keep this example as self contained as possible)

(defcomponent wiki-login ()
  ())

(defmethod render ((login wiki-login))
  (let ((username "")
        (password ""))
    (<ucw:form :action-body (wiki-login login username password)
      (<:p
        "Login with wiki/wiki.")
      (<:p
        (<:label :for "username" "Username: ")
        (<ucw:text :accessor username :id "username"))
      (<:p
        (<:label :for "password" "Password: ")
        (<ucw:password :accessor password :id "password"))

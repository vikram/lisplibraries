.TH UCWCTL 1 "May 01, 2006"

.SH NAME
ucwctl \- control the UnCommon Web Application Framework

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ucwctl
.RI [ options ]
.I action

.SH DESCRIPTION
UnCommon Web (UCW) is a way to develop interactive graphical
applications using Common Lisp and HTTP/HTML.
.P
.B ucwctl
manages to start or stop an UCW session via
.BR detachtty (1)
and
.BR cl-launch (1).
.P
It can also connect to a running UCW session via
.BR attachtty (1)
and then you can give commands to the Common Lisp REPL.
Alternatively, you can connect to a running UCW session using SLIME
from Emacs.

.SH OPTIONS
The default options are read from \fI/etc/ucw/ucwctl.conf\fP.
.TP
.BI \-a "\fR, \fP" \--asdf-root " directory"
Specify the directory which should be registered in the ASDF search
path.  Default is \fIempty\fP, you should sure be that UCW can find
all the necessary packages in the system ASDF search path.
.TP
.BI \-c "\fR, \fP" \--config-file " file"
Change the config file which is read by UCW.  If you do not need a
config file (because you have a special start file), use
\fI/dev/null\fP as config file.  Default is \fI/etc/ucw/conf.lisp\fP.
.TP
.BI \-h "\fR, \fP" \--help
Show the help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-k "\fR, \fP" \--stop-file " file"
Specify the stop file which \fBucwctl\fP uses to stop UCW.  This is
mandatory.  Default is \fI/etc/ucw/stop.lisp\fP.
.TP
.BI \-l "\fR, \fP" \--lisp " name"
Specify the name (without the complete path) of the Common Lisp
implementation to be used.  This is mandatory.
.TP
.BI \ \ \ \ \--log-root " directory"
Change the directory in which the logs are saved.  When set, this
option overrides the general \fB--var-root\fP.  Default is
\fIempty\fP, which is the same as specifying \fI/var/log/ucw\fP for
the root user or \fI~/log/ucw\fP for a normal one.
.TP
.BI \ \ \ \ \--run-root " directory"
Change the directory where the pid and the socket file are created.
When set, this option overrides the general \fB--var-root\fP.  Default
is \fIempty\fP, which is the same as specifying \fI/var/run/ucw\fP
for the root user or \fI~/run/ucw\fP for a normal one.
.TP
.BI \-s "\fR, \fP" \--start-file " file"
Specify the start file which \fBucwctl\fP uses to start UCW.  This is
mandatory.  Default is \fI/etc/ucw/start.lisp\fP.
.TP
.BI \-t "\fR, \fP" \--timeout " seconds"
Set how many seconds attachtty should wait while trying to stop a
running session.  Default is \fI5\fP.
.TP
.BI \-u "\fR, \fP" \--ucwctl-file " file"
Specify the file which contains the \fBucwctl\fP options.  Default
is \fI/etc/ucw/ucwctl.conf\fP and \fI~/.ucw/ucwctl.conf\fP, if they
exist, with the latter overriding the former.  If a different
\fIucwctl.conf\fP file is specified, it overrides all the defaults.
Moreover, command line options take precedence over values in
\fIucwctl.conf\fP files.
.TP
.BI \ \ \ \ \--var-root " directory"
Specify the directory where the logs are saved
(\fIdirectory/log/ucw\fP) and the pid/socket are created
(\fIdirectory/run/ucw\fP).  This is mandatory, unless you use the
\fB--log-root\fP and \fB--run-root\fP options.  Default is
\fI/var\fP for the root user or \fI~/var\fP for a normal one.

.SH ACTIONS
.TP
.B start
Load up UCW reading the start file.
.TP
.B stop
Try to stop a running UCW session via
.BR attachtty (1).
If that doesn't work, fall back to killing the process.
.TP
.B attach
Connect to a running UCW session via
.BR attachtty (1).
To detach from the tty leaving the server process running, send a
\fBSIGQUIT\fR (usually from the keyboard with ^\\).  See also
.BR attachtty (1).

.SH NOTES
The API documentation is, as much as possible, contained in the
docstrings of the various classes, methods, and packages which make up
UCW itself.  Using a good inspector (SLIME's inspector for example)
you should be able to easily navigate and browse the API.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
All the command options can be specified as environment variables.
.P
The default start file \fI/etc/ucw/start.lisp\fP loads up an UCW
session via the ASDF \fB:ucw.default\fP system, which reads the
following environment variables (exported by \fBucwctl\fP):
.P
.B CONFIGFILE
.br
.B LOGROOT

.SH BUGS
Please report bugs to <bese-devel@common-lisp.net>.  A collection of
all the known bugs and issues is present as text files in the
directory docs/issues.

;;;; * The RERL Protocol

;;;; A UCW server sits in a tight loop waiting for incoming HTTP
;;;; requests, elaborating them and then sending out the HTTP
;;;; responses. This loop is called the "RERL" (Request-Eval-Response
;;;; Loop) and the objects, methods and variables involved in the RERL
;;;; are described here.

;;;; ** Components

with the value COMPONENT answers. and continues whatever was
stopped when control was transfered to the component."))

  the component CALLEE.

CALLEE should replace CALLER in the user interface (by setting
itself in CALLER's place). CALLEE can return control to CALLER by

generally be called through the CALL macro."))

;;;; *** Sending the RESPONSE

;;;; There are two ways to send the response to the client. You can
;;;; choose to let the backend deal with it; in this case you should
;;;; send the data, as a sequence of characters, to the response's
;;;; html-stream and then call send-response. If you want to do it
;;;; yourself you should first call send-headers and then write the
;;;; data, as a sequence of bytes, to the response's
;;;; network-stream. Calling send-headers is, technically, optional,
;;;; you could just as well write the HTTP headers yourself. There are
;;;; two major differences between these options: 1) if you let the
;;;; backend do it the conversion from characters to bytes is done for
;;;; you (based on the response's Content-Type header) as is the
;;;; calculation of the Content-Length header; 2) if you bypass the
;;;; backend the data is sent directly to the client as it's produced
;;;; (i believe this is called streaming).

(defgeneric send-response (response)
  (:documentation "Assuming RESPONSE is complete send it to the
  client. When calling this function we assume all headers have
  already been set and the body's content has been collected in
  the response object."))

(defgeneric send-headers (response)
  (:documentation "Sends all the headers in RESPONSE to the
  client. Unlike the send-response method we don't add a
  Content-Length header, though if one is present in RESPONSE it
  will be sent.

After calling this method the response data, a sequence of bytes,
should be sent to RESPONSE's network-stream."))

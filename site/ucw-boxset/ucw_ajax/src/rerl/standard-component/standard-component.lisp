NAME, SUPERS and SLOTS as treated as per defclass. The following
extra options are allowed:

 (:ENTRY-POINT url (&key application class)) - Define an
 entry-point on the url URL which simply calls an instance of
 this component. Any request parameters passed to the entry-point
 are used to initialize the slots in the component. This option
 may appear multiple times.

 (:DEFAULT-BACKTRACK function-designator) - Unless the slots
 already have a :backtrack option FUNCTION-DESIGNATOR is
 added. As with the 'regular' :backtrack options if you pass T
 here it is assumed to mean #'IDENTITY.

 (:RENDER (&optional COMPONENT) &body BODY) - Generate a render
 method specialized to COMPONENT. COMPONENT may be a symbol, in
 which case the method will be specialized on the componnet
 class. If COMPONNET is omited the component is bound to a
 variable with the same name as the class.

 (:ACTION &optional NAME) - Generate a defaction form named
 NAME (which defaults to the name of the component) which simply
 CALL's this component class passing all the arguments passed to
 the action as initargs."

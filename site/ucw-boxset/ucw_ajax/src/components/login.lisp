This component, which must be embedded in another component,
presents the user with a simple two fielded login form.

When the user attempts a login the action try-login is called,
try-login calls the generic function check-credentials passing it
the login component. If check-credentials returns true then the
login-successful action is called, otherwise the message slot of
the login component is set (to a generic \"bad username\"
message).

The default implementaion of login-successful simply answers t,
no default implementation of check-credentials is
provided. Developers should use sub-classes of login for which
all the required methods have been definined.")

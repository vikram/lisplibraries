2 main threads:

 * accept-thread sits in a tight loop waiting for incoming
   connections on the backend's socket. When it gets a connection
   it sends the CONNECTION message to control thread with the
   newly created stream.

 * control-thread sits and reacts to various messages:

   1) SHUTDOWN - sends SHUTDOWN messages to the workers and then
      closes all the sockets and streams.

   2) CONNECTION - Removes a worker from the pool and sends it a
      CONNECTION message. A new worker will be spawned if none
      are available up to worker-max.  When the worker is
      finished it sends a WORKER-DONE message.

   3) WORKER-DONE - A worker has finished processing a request
      and will be restored to the pool.  4) ERROR - A worker has
      encountered an error.

Seperate lists are kept for all workers for use when shutting and
of the available-workers for handling request."))

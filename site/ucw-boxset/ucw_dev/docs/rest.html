      <h2>On REST</h2>

      <p>In short: The REST camp is right, but our definition of
      &quot;web application&quot; is too wide. The term &quot;web
      application,&quot; in its common use, appiles to two radically
      different things whcih both travel over HTTP:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>databases interfaces (amazon is the classical example but
        sites such as lexus nexus and ebay fit in here as well). These
        are systems where someone is asking a server for
        information.</li>
        <li>applications which just happen to use the browser for the
        GUI. (what you called interactive applications).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>I'd argue that REST is the perfect (and only) tool for the
      first category, while continuations work great for the
      second. I'd also argue that most &quot;web sites&quot; are a mix
      of both. Take amazon for example, when I use amazon there are
      two independant things i want to do 1) browse for books and 2)
      buy books. the browsing part should follow the REST principles,
      however the buying part should not, purchasing a book is an
      inherently statefull operation which requires the server to
      maintain some of the client's state. The order of operations in
      purchasing a book is complex and, imnsho, much easier to express
      using continutations. At the same time writing the code to show
      book details is much easier when you just transalte a url into
      an sql query and show the resulting rows.</p>

      <div class="roberts">
        <p>I'm not totally convinced that the checkout portion can't
        be made REST as well. The REST crowd actually thinks
        so. Clearly, there is state, but they would say that the state
        should either return with the next request or should be stored
        on the server side in the database, not carried in the web
        server. That may be bending the rules on REST, though.</p>

        <div class="baringer">
          <p>i'm not going to argue that i can't, only that it
          shouldn't.</p>

          <p>The application, and its underlying database, have a
          certain state which is global and shared by everyone. Then
          there is the state of GUI, this information (what page we're
          looking at, what the navigation history is, etc.) may be
          implemented in the DB but it's not application state, its
          GUI state.</p>

          <p>When the REST guys start sending this GUI state in the
          response objects they run into a number of obstacles (since
          they need to send <i>all</i> of the GUI state
          for <i>every</i> response): 1) object marshalling, 2)
          malicious clients 3) request/response size
          limits. Continuation based apps need only send: 1) a key
          (generally a random string a few tens of characters long)
          specifying the session and the point in the sesion history,
          2) what's changed in the user interface.</p>

          <div class="roberts">
            <p>Right. I would agree that it's much easier to just use
            standard session data like most web servers provide
            today. The REST guys would just argue that it's less
            scalable. And they're right, too. The big question is,
            does it only matter for sites like Amazon or EBay which
            are <b>massive</b>, or does it come into play at lower levels
            of scalability, too.</p>

            <div class="baringer">
              <p>The REST guys are against sessions? I don't think
              that's what they meant; how else would you ever
              implement anything personalized?</p>

              <div class="roberts">
                <p>Yep, they're against sessions and consequently
                generally down on personalization. Their answer is
                that this isn't REST.</p>

                <p>I should probably qualify it, though. *In the
                context of REST*, they are down on those concepts. I
                think you'd find many people that would say, "Sure,
                the only way to implement personalization is with
                sessions, and that's fine when you want to go that
                way, but realize that you are now stepping out of a
                REST architecture style and you're going to pay that
                penalty" This is one reason why I think REST is most
                applicable to web applications that would otherwise
                use SOAP (i.e. "web services," not something
                interactive).</p>
              </div>

              <p>Maybe this is just another case of distinguishing
              between web apps as "collections of resources named by
              urls" and web apps as "applications which happen to use
              the browser for a GUI"</p>

              <div class="roberts"><p>Yes, indeed.</p></div>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="baringer">
      <p>This doesn't mean that you can't shoe-horn the statefull part
      of the application into REST but it does mean that REST is not
      the best option for this (and vice versa).</p>

      <div class="roberts">
        <p>Right. The question really is, what penalty are you paying
        when you move outside the REST style, and can you afford
        that. In some cases, you probably can. My big question is, how
        much is the penalty for continuations? If it's small, then no
        biggie. If large, then you really have to think about it. I
        could see continuations being very large, depending on how
        they were implemented, and that would definitely push you to
        larger and larger server front-ends with all the consequent
        headache.</p>

        <div class="baringer">
          <p>when you talk about continuations and web apps
          (interactive applications with a web GUI) there are (mainly)
          two places where the continutaions come into play:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><p>writing the code - we (some of us at least) would like
            to write our code sequentially, even though it will be
            executed asynchronously and certain parts of it may be
            executed multiple times (think back button and window
            cloning). there is no penalty here if the contiuations are
            implemented by a compile time code transformation (as ucw
            does). [well, there is a slight penalty since we introduce
            an oscene number of lambda calls, but its basically 0
            compared to reading/writing the requests/response (trust
            me on this)]. Even when you use "full" built in
            continuations (as SeaSide and PLT scheme do) the overhead
            is still little more than a couple function calls and some
            memory (stact) manipulation.</p>

              <div class="roberts">
                <p>The only thing I was worried about was the memory
                allocation, not the time to render the page. As you
                say, either style's speed difference is swamped by the
                cost of the I/O. Again, my main issue is how much
                memory I'm sucking up with all those various
                continuations hanging around. And remember that I have
                multiple continuations per page (every link,
                right?). That could easily be many KB per
                continuation. Depending on how much back-button saving
                state I want to hang around, I could literally have
                MBs per user. If my policy is to let that stuff hang
                around until a timeout of some sort or an explicit
                logout/finish purchase point, I have to worry about
                how many people abandon their session, etc. You get
                the idea.</p>

                <div class="baringer">
                  
                  <p>a ucw session object consists of:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>a 40 character id string</li>
                    <li>a last-access time (a fixnum)</li>
                    <li>an object table (an eql hash table)</li>
                    <li>a list of session-frame objects</li>
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>each session frame object consits of:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>a 20 character id string</li>
                    <li>a component object (which may contain other
                    component objects).</li>
                    <li>a hash table mapping action-ids (10 character
                    strings) to closures.</li>
                    <li>a hash table mapping callback-ids (10
                    character strings) to closures.</li>
                    <li>a list of (value . ucw:place). a value is a
                    lisp object, ucw:place is an object with 3
                    closures (one for getting the current value, one
                    for setting and one for copying).</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>what you (and i) should be worried about are all
                  those closure objects. a closure consists of two
                  things: 1) a code vector and 2) an environment. the
                  code vector is shared across all closures in all
                  sessions, so all we're really worried about is the
                  environment. the environment is bascially a
                  (constant size) vector of objects, assuming has a
                  page has ten links each with an action (in ucw the
                  actions are generally simple forms which call some
                  function on the srever) we'll have a couple objets
                  in the environment. each of these objects is however
                  shared across all the closure in the page. in all
                  honesty i don't think the cost of memory is such an
                  issue , i did some quick math and came up with about
                  400 bytes per session + 700 bytes per
                  request/response iteration (assuming you backtrack
                  about 10 objects per request/response and assuming
                  each "slot" is 4 byte wide (immediate objects are
                  saved in the slot, non immediates require some
                  memory for the data as well). would this be a big
                  issue for sites like amazon and ebay? yes. is this
                  an issue for 99% of the web apps out there?
                  considering how the cost of 1GB of RAM, no.</p>

                  <p>what is a much bigger issue is farming out
                  sessions. if you don't want to get swamped in
                  serializeng/deserializng objects and sending them
                  over the network you really need to leave a session
                  on the same machine for its entire life, while
                  dobale (i should have a client who will fund this
                  work in a few months) it's not immediate and you
                  still run the risk of having one machine at 100% CPU
                  and another idle.</p>

                  <div class="roberts">
                    <p>This is pretty easy and done all the
                    time. That's why load balancers implement a sticky
                    policy to keep a given client bound to the same
                    front-end web server. The issue then becomes how
                    critical that data is in the event of a server
                    failure, but the scalability model has been
                    conquered.</p>

                </div>
              </div>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>saving the state - when the user clicks on a link we
              want to make sure that the state of the app as the
              _user_ saw it on the page corresponds to the state on
              the server, even when the user has used the back
              button. in this case you, developer, have to tell the
              framework what state shoud be saved and restored based
              on the user's request and what state is global and
              doesn't change even though the user has "undone" some
              pages.</p>

              <p>generally we save the state regarding the GUI (values
              of forms, what the &quot;current&quot; page is, state of
              the navigation menu) and don't save the general
              application state (user data, db manipulations, etc.)
              how much you save is up to the developer. i'd like to
              point out that this penalty (saving and restoring GUI
              state) is taken even by REST apps (if they want to do
              things right), it's just that's its done by
              hand.</p>

              <div class="roberts">
                <p>Yes, agreed. State is state. You have to store it somewhere and then
                restore it when you get another request.</p>

                <div class="baringer">
                  <p>the difference is who has to deal with that
                  job. in a continuation based system you usally end
                  up with a framework where the saving and restoring
                  is done by the framework itself, all you (developer)
                  have to do is use tha data. in the rest frameworks
                  i've seen you have to do this work yourself.</p>

                  <div class="roberts">
                    <p>Right, agreed. The explicit model forces you to
                    do more work. The continuation model makes this
                    seamless, but could hand you a huge scalability
                    problem if you aren't conscious about what's
                    happening behind the scenes. Like any high-level
                    paradigm (language, for instance), they can make
                    some things seem really easy, but that can mask
                    performance problems if you aren't careful.</p>

      <p>The problem most people face is that you never hear about
      applications-which-use-browser-for-a-GUI, what you see 99% of
      the time are regular old web applications whose underyling
      paradigm hasn't changed since 1992. Those real world
      applications (#2 above) are usually deployed on an intranet and
      neither look nor feel (nor are considered) different from a
      regular desktop application.</p>

      <div class="roberts">
        <p>How do you mean that you never hear about those? Can you give me an

          <p>i've developed a document management systems for a law
          office and various patient management systems for hospitals,
          i've worked on buisness intelligence and e-learning
          tools. None of these apps were ever accessable to the public
          nor did they ever have to deal with more than 50
          simultaneous users, though they did have extremly complex
          user interactions.</p>

            <p>Ah, got it. I guess that's the sort of app that I think
            that continuation-based methods would work well on. If the
            user count is low and the scalability doesn't have to go
            higher than those sorts of numbers, I see no reason not to
            use almost whatever technique is most expedient
            (continuation, REST, or something else).</p>

      <h2>On State Machines</h2>

      <p>I don't think it's ever been proven, but i've a strong
      feeling that state machines are another way of writing cps code
      (and vice versa). if we have some code like this:</p>

      <div class="roberts">
        <p>Actually, I think it has been proven, but perhaps in
        another context.  Really, this is just the same old tension
        between old linear, sequential programming and event-driven
        programming, ala the original Mac GUI in 1984. The only
        difference between the two is where you store the state of the
        state machine. In the sequential code/continuation case, it's
        in the activation records sitting on the stack. In the state
        machine case, it's more explicit. Neither is ultimately more
        expressive, just different.</p>

        <div class="baringer">
          <p>right. however i still think that while the underlying
          machinery is more explicit in the state machine the high
          level goals are more explict in the continuation case.</p>

          <div class="roberts">
            <p>I suppose it depends on what you're comfortable
            with. Again, I often think in terms of state machines
            anyway. Either way, we're mapping a series of HTTP
            requests onto some sort of model and using that to
            simplify our thinking. You think sequentially; I often
            think in terms of state machines.</p>

      <pre>
(do-one-thing)
(show-a-page)
(do-another-thing)
(show-another-page)
(done)
      </pre>

      <p>that's basically the same as writing:</p>

      <pre>
(loop
  with state = 'initial
  do (case state
       (initial
         (do-one-thing)
         (print 'a-page)
         (setf state 'post-one-thing))
       (post-one-thing
         (do-another-thing)
         (print 'another-page)
         (setf state 'post-another-thing))
       (post-another-thing
         (done)
         (setf state 'done))))
      </pre>

      <p>it's just a lot harder to read. </p>

      <div class="roberts">
        <p>Yup. I wonder if it wouldn't make sense to develop a small
        interpreted Lisp language (in Lisp, of course) that would
        drive the high-level page flow and allow you to save off
        continuations appropriately. Either that or some radical
        macros that would allow you to write in a very linear style
        but would explode to a full state machine with very optimized
        state storage. That's the fun thing about Lisp, I
        suppose--everything is possible and relatively easy to
        implement.</p>

        <div class="baringer">
          
          <p>i had guessed you knew about <a
          href="http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw">UnCommom
          Web</a>. UCW contains a cps transformer and the machinery
          for saving the lexical and GUI state, developers don't even
          need to know what a continuation is to use it, they just
          write:</p>

          <pre>
(defaction do-something ((c my-task-component))
  (do-one-thing)
  ;; pass do-another-thing the informaiot collected in a-page  
  (do-another-thing (call 'a-page))
  ;; pass done the information collected in another-page  
  (done (call 'another-page)))
          </pre>

          <p>except for the html generation that's all there is to
          it. the code will &quot;block&quot; when the forms (call 'a-page) and
          (call 'another-page) are executed and will only continue
          when those pages &quot;return&quot;.</p>

          <div class="roberts">
            <p>Got it. Very interesting. Yes, that's basically what I
            had in mind.  Given that you're doing this in CL, you have
            to fake the continuations with a macro transformation into
            CPS style. That's cool though. Any idea how much state
            you're saving per continuation?</p>

            <div class="baringer">
              <p>the components a-page and another-page will need to
              "answer" at some point so that the forms (call 'a-page)
              and (call 'another-page) return. let's assume those
              component are immediate (don't ever call other
              components) and present two links, one which returns t
              and one which returns nil. let us also assume the
              components backtrack two places each (useing the shallow
              copyer). in order to complete the action do-something
              there will be, with these assumpitons, two pages seen by
              the user. so:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>1 session object</li>
                <li>2 session-frame objects (eacch session-frame
                object represents one request/response cycle)</li>
                <li>6 backtracked places (2 for the first component, 2
                for the next component. the first 2 are copied in the
                second request).</li>
                <li>2 closures for the actions (with any empty closed
                over environment)</li>
                <li>2 10 character string for the ids for the actions</li>
                <li>2 closures for the a-page and another-page's
                continuations (which in this case only close over the
                variable c).</li>
              </ul>

              <p>that's basically it. should the user use the back
              button certain functions will be called again but the
              amout of memory used won't increase.</p>

              <p>note the each link in the page does not create a
              continuation. each link simply calls a function, the
              "continuations" only come into play when a component
              answers. each component object has its continuation and
              these continuations are nothing more than closures (so
              the code vector itself is compiled and shared across all
              instances while only the envornment changes from
              component to component).</p>

              <div class="roberts">
                <p>My head is spinning at this point. I need to dig
                into the code and see what's really doing on. I can't
                follow the thread of control at the time of rendering
                and overall through the application from that
                description above (not your fault; I just don't
                understand enough UCW terminology yet).</p>

                <div class="baringer">
                  <p>you can't understand because te only place its
                  described is the code.  here's a high level
                  description of the standard rerl implementation,
                  tell me if its clear enough:</p>

                  <p>every time a user "uses" a ucw app they have one
                  session object, every request/response cycle gets
                  one session frame. every time a ucw recieves an http
                  request it basically does this:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>find the session object specified by the
                    request. (requests generally pass a parameter
                    named +session-parameter-name+ ("s" in the defalut
                    setup). [applications of type cookie-session use
                    cookies for this, but the idea is the same]</li>

                    <li>find the corresponding session-frame which
                    generated the page the user used to make this
                    request. this is kind of murky so i'll reexplain
                    in. we assume that every request to a ucw app is
                    caused by some precedeing request generating a
                    link. the exception to this is the very first time
                    you go to a ucw appilcation, here we pass the work
                    over to entry-points, however things are simpler
                    if we leave entry-points out of it for now and
                    assume that every http request is following a link
                    (or submitting a form) generated by a previous
                    response.</li>

                    <li>once we've found the "causing" session frame
                    we look in the http request and find the specified
                    action-id, this action-id corresponds to a lambda
                    on the server.</li>

                    <li>before funcall'ing the action we need to
                    restore the state as it was when the action lambda
                    was generated. we do this by "restoring" all the
                    places which were registreed for backtracking. the
                    session frame objects holds a set of backtrack
                    objects which tell us 1) what the value of the
                    place was when the frame was generated, 2) how to
                    set modify the place.</li>

                    <li>now we're done with the "causing" session
                    frame and generate a new one which represents this
                    new request/response cycle. the new frame will
                    have, initially, an empty set of
                    action-ids/action-lambdas, a set of backtracks
                    (containing a copy of all the previous frame's
                    backtrack objects).</li>

                    <li>we can know finally funcall the action, the
                    action we're talking about here are usually very
                    simple lambda which call "real" actions defined
                    via defaction. during the course of this a couple
                    things will happen: (in whatever order):

                      <ol>
                        <li>actions will be registered. this is usally
                          done through the high level &lt;ucw:a macro (or
                          its tla equivalent). it creates a url which,
                          when requested, causes the lambda to be
                          funcall'd. registring an action adds an
                          entry to our action-id/action hash
                          table. [technically this will happen in step
                          6, but its easier to conceptualize if you
                          consider it happeening here].</li>

                        <li>call forms may be executed. this will stop
                        whatever the action is doing, change the
                        component tree so that the 'current' component
                        is substituded with the new component, and
                        cause us to jump to step 6. note that not all
                        actions will use call (or answer) and may
                        simply leave the component tree as it is.</li>

                        <li>answer forms may be executed. this will
                        cause the current component to be 'forgetten'
                        (it will evenutally get gc'd) and whatever
                        call form whcih generated the component which
                        is now answering will return (and exuction
                        will continue from there).</li>

                        <li>callbacks may be registered. callbacks are
                        a special mechanism for dealing with request
                        parameters, just ignore them for now. (or
                        study the :accessor yaclml/tal attribute
                        mechanism).  [technically this will also (like
                        action registration) happen in step 6.]</li>

                        <li>at same point the action must put a
                        component object in the session-frame's
                        window-component slot. usually entry-points do
                        this and actions simply don't change it (its
                        saved across session-frames), the important
                        thing is that after the action
                        window-component contains a component.</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>go through the list of backtrack objects in
                    the new frame, save them and store them in the
                    frame object (so that the next frame can restore
                    them).</li>

                    <li>once the action returns, either "naturally" or
                    via a CALL form, we acall render-on on the frame's
                    window-component. this method must make sure that
                    any nested componets get passed to render-on we've
                    finally finished and the html we'll show to user
                    is stored in the response object. we can now
                    "shutdown" the response and hope the backend sends
                    it off the client's browser.</li>

                    <li>lather, rinse, repeat.</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>uncommon web has a main loop which looks more or less like
      this:</p>

      <pre>
(loop
  for request = (read-request)
  for state = (fetch-state request)
  for new-state = (handle-action state request)
  do (setf (fetch-state request) new-state))
      </pre>

      
      <p>a while ago i wrote the control loop for a dynamic (states
      and state transfer functions were put into hash tables and
      changed at run time) state machine and it's main loop looked
      very similar to that.</p>

      <div class="roberts">
        <p>Right. I'm not sure that's actually much easier to
        read/write at the end of the day. You're just making a state
        machine with a hashtable doing the state lookup and dispatch
        rather than a case.</p>

        <div class="baringer">
          <p>depends on who writes it. in ucw it's written by the
          framework so i don't really care (or know :)) how hard/easy
          it is to write.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Personally, I find state machines very natural to write
        in. Perhaps that's my hardware background coming
        through. Rather that avoid the abstraction, I'm more willing
        to just embrace it. Its sort of like Linus writing Linux in C
        and disallowing all sorts of typedefs because he wants
        everybody to know when they're manipulating a structure and
        when they aren't. Part of me prefers to map my brain onto the
        underlying problem such that it's more well understood.</p>

        <div class="baringer">
          <p>I'd assume that that part of your brain knows when the
          mapping is helpfull and when it's not (your brain doesn't
          map LOOP constructs into the underlying assembler).</p>

          <div class="roberts">
            <p>Right, agreed. My motto is just to pick an abstraction
            that works. I'm not in the camp that all you have is a
            hammer and therefore everything should be viewed as a
            nail. ;-)</p>
          </div>

          <p>the reason ucw exists is that, in web applications, the
          underlying techincal details are so diametrically opposed to
          the high level problem. attempting to map "do this, then if
          A do that else loop over page B" to the http
          request/response paradigm is such a pain that you just give
          up on complex interactions.</p>

          <p>[This is provacative but not complety untrue:</p>

          <p>The REST camp is trying to simplify the world so that the
          problem ceases to exist. The continuation camp is solving
          the problem.]</p>

          <div class="roberts">
            <p>You're right. That's provocative. ;-) I don't see that
            the REST camp is avoiding the problem so much as they are
            trying to make sure that people understand the
            tradeoffs. Even the REST people will say that sometimes
            you should just whack out something quickly with SOAP if
            you know that scalability is never going to be an issue. I
            think for interactive apps, they would just make sure that
            everybody is aware of the tradeoffs and then say, "Hey, if
            you can live with the scalability limits imposed by your
            particular architectural style, then fine. Get on with
            it."</p>

            <div class="baringer">
              <p>you're trying to introduce the vaice of reason into

          </div>

          <p>Anyway, my point(s):</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Knowing when to use the right tool (and knowing what
            the available tools are and what their characteristiscs
            are) is an essential part of software development.</p>

              <div class="roberts">
                <p>Yup, fully agree. In fact, that was exactly my
                motivation for asking the question. Continuations are
                clearly nice. But how far can they take you and where
                do they break down. Clearly REST is more scalable,
                blah, blah, but it's also a bit more complex because
                you may have to fit your application into a style that
                is less natural. Therefore, when should somebody go
                through the pain of choosing a REST style when it
                isn't natural?</p>
              </div>
            </li>

            <li><p>Continuations in web apps do not allow you to do
            anything which can't be done without them, though i'd
            argue that there are certain user interactions which are
            too complex to manage (for a developer's point of view)
            without them.</p>

              <div class="roberts">
                <p>I'd probably agree with that, but again, the
                threshold for "too complex" is probably higher than
                yours is, just because I seem to be more comfortable
                with a state machine architectural style. But yes, I
                agree.</p>
              </div>
            </li>

            <li><p>Continuations have a non zero cost. However much of
            that cost already exists in REST apps when they attempt to
            offer the same functionality as continuation based
            apps.</p>

            <div class="roberts">
              <p>It would be interesting to turn this into hard
              numbers. For instance, exactly how much state is being
              saved with every continuation?</p>

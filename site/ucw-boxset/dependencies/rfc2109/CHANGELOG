  * Created a rfc2109.test system
  
  Splitting the file into a main/test would have been a bad idea due to the smart
  inlining with the standard's text.
  
  The previous solution to always load the file is also bad for performance.
  
  The hopefully final solution is to create an rfc2109.test system and before loading
  rfc2109.lisp in it rebind *features* and push a symbol (:test) into it. The main
  lisp file #+test for this symbol and defines the tests when it's loaded through
  rfc2109.test.

  * Disable fasl compilation in the asdf file
  
  This way we can get rid of the errors arising when rfc2109 is compiled
  with 5am loaded and later loaded from fasl without 5am loaded.

  UNDO: Added missing fiveam dependency

  * rfc2109: allow non-conformant paths, thanks to Richard Newman
  Finally allow non-conformant paths. If the corrects-path-p option
  to cookie-string is nil, the library will not coerce the path to
  correctness.

  * rfc2109: allow nil to be passed to safe-parse-cookies
  The docs say that you can pass nil to safe-parse-cookies to have no
  legal domains to allow cookies to come from (ie they must come from your
  server or not at all).
  Whoops.

  * rfc2109 - Marco applied the 5am patch, changed keyword
  Marco wanted the feature keyword to be 5am. Less typing for me!

  * rfc2109: Add basic testing and a tester
  Decided to add a basic testing framework - mostly because I'm mucking about
  with parsing and another library, want something to let me know when I've
  REALLY screwed up.
  
  Please note that the current stable version of FiveAM will not run these tests,
  as it doesn't have the *features* that are needed to define them. I've submitted
  a patch to Marco, we'll see if he adds it.

  Don't really know how I missed updating the version number for 0.2 and 0.2.1...

  * rfc2109: add a note about Moz and IE's lack of RFC compliance
  Mozilla, Links, and IE all have a problem with quoted PATHs. As quoted paths
  are demanded by the RFC, there's really no way around this. Luckily, Moz
  has this fixed in latest alpha. Note added to docs as well as workaround suggestion.
  
  Bug reference:
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=277033
  
  There is the option of adding a bonus-points-compatible-cookie-string option for
  outputing compatible code, but I would really rather not go down that road.
  Output strict, accept loose.

  * rfc2109: Update safe-parse-cookies using new understanding of domain cookies
  After sorting out what the issue was with explicit domains, update safe-parse-cookies
  (mostly documentation) to reflect this knowledge.

  * rfc2109: redefine valid domain based on a re-reading of 4.3.2
  w3m and the Mozilla bugs set me straight on the reading of 4.3.2.
  This patch requires an explicitly defined domain for domain, meaning
  it must be:
  a value
  start with a "."
  and contain an embedded "."

  * Implement domain-match-p
  While debugging an issue with w3m and cookies (which hasn't gone away, btw),
  I needed to check my knowledge of a "domain-match" - I've included the function
  in case others find it useful.

Thu Aug  4 16:53:36 CDT 2005  Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu
  * parse-cookie-string needs to allow quoted strings inside it
  Wrote a small tokenizer that splits - taking into account quoted strings.
  We're really getting to the point that a pattern language would be useful.
  
  Anyways, it works well, now.

Thu Aug  4 16:52:46 CDT 2005  Alan-Shields@omrf.ouhsc.edu
  * No longer demand domains of the style ".blah.blah"
  Turns out that the RFC allows (in fact desires) domains of the style "blah.blah",
  so those are now legal.

  * Fix QUOTED-STRING? to take into account escaped quotes
  You know, I wrote a function to remove escaped quotes from a string...
  amazing that I didn't use it. Now I do.
  
  Also, I tucked the helper function for removing escaped quotes into
  the function that uses it. Much cleaner that way.

  SBCL was whining about vars being used before they're declared. Sensible, I suppose.
  Moved and made a note.

  * Fix token? and quoted-string? to account for empty and non-empty strings
  The specification for tokens says that they must be at least one character.
  Fixed.
  
  The specification for quoted strings says that the empty quoted string is
  acceptible. Fixed. So we can now have "" values.

  * Include the license text and some bookmark-like strings
  Marco suggested that I include the license text in its entirety.
  Also included some text strings that are easy to find so as to get
  to the most externally-relevant code.

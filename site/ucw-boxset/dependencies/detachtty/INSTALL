INSTALLATION

The Makefile apparently requires GNU Make; if you have some other Make
program, you'll need to edit it by hand - or install GNU Make, of course.

vi Makefile
make
make install

... or on a Debian (woody, sid, or later) box:

apt-get install detachtty

This is a native Debian package, which means that if you are having
trouble with the Debian version there is usually little point in
trying the upstream version to see if it's improved.

PORTING

detachtty is tested primarily on GNU/Linux boxes.  It should work on
 - anything with a forkpty() call
 - anything with an openpty() call that the code in forkpty.c will run on
but you may need to tune things

(1) Look at the Makefile.  Alter OS_CFLAGS, OS_LOADLIBES, OS_OBJECTS
as necessary.

(2) If that's insufficient (e.g. you need more header files), add the
necessary stanzas to config.h and return to step 1

(3) If that's still insufficent, do something else reasonably tasteful,
or mail me describing what else you need

(4) Send me your patch

(NB: auto* is _not_ reasonably tasteful)

  			    detachtty

detachtty lets you run interactive programs non-interactively, and
connect to them over the network when you do need to interact with them.

If you've used screen, it's a similar concept.  Compared to screen,
detachtty has

 * no capability to swap between different screens (it doesn't co-opt C-a)
 * no tty emulation (you can sanely use it in emacs comint modes)
 * no features (less to go wrong)
 * no configuration file
 * ability to spawn ssh to securely connect across the network

* What it's for - a likely usage scenario

I have a persistent server implemented in Lisp.  Usually it sits there
serving things, but sometimes (for example when a new version is
available and it needs to be upgraded) I need to connect to it and
type Lisp at it.

Why don't I use screen?  I could - I used to do exactly that - but
then I have to talk directly to the CMUCL repl, which means no command
line editing.  I want to use ILISP, but (1) screen's terminal handling
is likely to confuse Emacs, (2) screen isn't network-enabled and the
server machine doesn't have Emacs installed anyway.

* How it works:

detachtty has two parts: 

** detachtty  - the server

opens a pseudoterminal and starts your program on the slave end.  It
then copies between that tty and a unix-domain socket whose location
you specify when you start it

detachtty has options to fork into the background, to specify the
socket location, and to govern the placement of its log file and of
the dribble file from the application underneath it

** attachtty  - the client

When you want to connect to the process, attachtty attaches to the
unix-domain socket and copies input/output to and from you.  

If you have ssh installed and set up, you can also use attachtty
across the network.  This requires 

- that you also have attachtty installed on the machine that you are
  running detachtty on, and that it's somewhere on the path

- that you have ssh set up not to need to ask for a password (e.g
  using ssh-agent)

It's often nice to be able to interrupt a process, especially when
it's stuck in some kind of loop.  attachtty catches SIGINT and sends
the character \003 into the pty master, which causes the controlled
process to get a SIGINT of its own.  This works at least for using
with ILISP and CMUCL.

* Using it - an example

server$ detachtty --help
detachtty: unrecognized option `--help'
usage: 
 detachtty [--no-detach] [--dribble-file name] [--log-file name] \
   [--pid-file name] socket-path command [arg] [arg] [arg] ...

server$ detachtty --dribble-file /var/log/cliki-dribble --log-file \
  /var/log/detachtty.log --pid-file /var/run/cliki.pid \
  /var/run/cliki-socket /usr/bin/lisp -eval '(load-system :telentweb)' \
  -eval '(progn (telentweb::init) (telentweb::start))' \

client$ attachtty dan@server:/var/run/cliki-socket

** Signals and log files

When detachtty receives a SIGHUP, it closes and reopens its log and dribble
files, so it should play nice with whatever log rotation tools you already
use.  Note that the dribble file especially can grow large quite quickly  

The SIGHUP should be sent to detachtty, not to the child.  What the child
does with signals depends entirely on what the child is ...


* Security considerations

- detachtty performs no authentication of who's attached.  You choose
where the socket is created in the filesystem, so choose somewhere
that other people can't get to.

(detachtty creates its socket with mode 0700.  Some Unix systems -
Linux among them - honour file permissions on sockets, so only the
original user or root will be able to connect to it.  However, "many
BSD derived systems [...] ignore permissions for Unix sockets" so you
need to check if this will help you or not.)

- communication across the net is done using ssh.  If there is a
program on your computer called "ssh", then whatever level of security
it provides is available here

- no serious effort has been made to examine the attachtty and
detachtty code for buffer overruns etc.  If you are planning on using
these setuid or in some other untrusted-user situation, now is the
time to think of an alternative plan.


* Where to get it

detachtty is part of the Debian GNU/Linux system.  Debian "woody" and
"sid" users should find that "apt-get install detachtty" will download
and install it for them.

Users of other platforms are invited to check the CLiki page at
<URL:http://ww.telent.net/cliki/detachtty> which should always contain
a link to a download location.


* Feedback, feature requests, patches

to dan@telent.net, or using the Debian bug tracking system (bug reports 
can be sent to the BTS even if you're not using Debian; it's exactly
the same package either way), or leave a note on the CLiki page

AllegroServe Source Distribution ReadMe file

The source for AllegroServe is distributed under version 2.1 of
the Lesser GNU Public License, as clarified by the AllegroServe
prequel found in license-allegroserve.txt.


This document describes how to use the source to build AllegroServe.

To determine the version number for this software, look
in main.cl for *aserve-version*.



How to build and test AllegroServe:

1. start lisp
    
   This should work in a lisp running in a :case-insensitive-upper
   or :case-sensitive-lower mode, although we do most of our running
   and testing in a :case-sensitive-lower lisp.
   The current case mode is the value of excl:*current-case-mode*

2. load in the file load.cl 

   user(1):  :ld <path-to-aserve>/load.cl

   it will compile and and load all of AllegroServe, and it will load in
   the examples file too.


3. start the server

    user(2):  (net.aserve:start :port 8000)

    you can omit the port argument on Windows where any process can
    allocate port 80 (as long as it's unused).

4.  try out the server

    go to a web browser and try http://your-machine-name:8000/
    
    If the web browser is on the same machine as AllegroServe is running
    you can use
	   http://localhost:8000/
    as well



Now that you've verified that it works, you'll want to create
an aserve.fasl that you can load into your application.


5.  change lisp's current directory to be where the AllegroServe source
    is.

    user(3): :cd  <path-to-aserve>

    
6.  make a distribution

    user(4): (make-aserve.fasl)


7.  now you'll find aserve.fasl in the aserve source directory.

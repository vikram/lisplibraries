This directory contains source that is needed to run Portable
AllegroServe but is maintained elsewhere.  This code is included in
CVS so that portableaserve can be run without the usual hunt for a
gazillion libraries.

A reasonable effort is made to provide current upstream versions of
these libraries here; reports of outdated libraries are welcome
(report to portableaserve-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net; thanks!).
If one or more of these libraries are already installed on the
system, the existing ones are used (thanks to asdf).

What do we need?

- asdf

  Daniel Barlow's defsystem utility ("Another System Definition
  Facility").  In an ideal world, this would be included with the
  Lisp system.  For Debian, sbcl and OpenMCL version > 0.14, the
  world is already ideal  :)

- puri

  Franz Inc. released their uri library under the same license as
  AllegroServe, and Kevin Rosenberg made a portable version.

  <h3>About</h3>

  <p>
    Closure HTML was written
    by <a href="http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~unk6/">Gilbert
    Baumann</a> as part of the Closure web browser.  It was first
    converted into a stand-alone installation by Ignas Mikalajūnas, and
    finally reassembled and documented for integration with Closure XML
    and use with the Closure browser by David Lichteblau under its
    current name.

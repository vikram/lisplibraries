Closure HTML

   An HTML parser written in Common Lisp.

   Closure HTML was written by Gilbert Baumann as part of the Closure
   web browser. It was first converted into a stand-alone installation by
   Ignas Mikalajunas, and finally reassembled and documented for
   integration with Closure XML and use with the Closure browser by David
   Lichteblau under its current name.

   It available under an MIT-style license.

   from the XML sources (requires xsltproc).

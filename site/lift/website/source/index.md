### What it is

LIFT is yet another **LI**sp **F**ramework for **T**esting. It started out firmly in the [SUnit][] / [JUnit][] mold but has evolved to include better unit testing features and system test features as well. It also has a much spunkier acronym.

The best place to get an overview of LIFT and its features is in the [user's guide][8]. Though still a work in progress, it covers all of LIFT's basic features and many of its more advanced ones too.

[TINAA][9] documentation for LIFT is [available][10].

Those with an archeological bent might find the following interesting:

  * A [2003 paper][11] from the International Lisp Conference described LIFT as it was then, and 
  * My presentation from the conference
    * As a [Flash Presentation][12] (and I don't know how to navigate in this either... It's exported from Keynote)
    * As a [PDF][13]

The externals of LIFT haven't changed too much though the implementation has been improved...

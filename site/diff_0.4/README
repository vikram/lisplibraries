DIFF is a package for computing various forms of differences between
blobs of data and then doing neat things with those differences.
Currently diff knows how to compute three common forms of differences:

* "unified" format diffs, suitable for inspecting changes between
  different versions of files;
* "context" format diffs, suitable for inspecting changes between
  different versions of files;
* "vdelta" format binary diffs, which might be useful in a version
  control system for compact storage of deltas.

An ASDF system is provided; there are no symbols exported from the DIFF
package, as a good interface has not yet been decided upon.
Documentation is fairly sparse.

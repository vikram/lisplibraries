2007-03-07  Zach Beane  <xach@gwi.net>

	* Made 0.7.4 release.

	* examples/png.lisp: Remove some work-in-progress cruft.

2007-03-06  Zach Beane  <xach@gwi.net>

	* Made 0.7.3 release.

	* deflate-stream-interface.lisp (string-to-octets): Use
	custom:*default-file-encoding* when converting a string to octets
	on CLISP.

	* zlib.lisp (zlib-write-string): Don't bypass zlib-write-sequence;
	it's where the adler32 checksum is maintained. Thanks to Jason
	S. Cornez for noticing the bug.

2005-04-28  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* Made 0.7.2 release.

	* Fixed flush-deflate-stream; when running past the end of the
	buffer, call the callback instead of looping forever doing
	nothing. Bug reported by Yannick Gingras.

2005-04-05  Zach Beane  <xach@gwi.net>

	* Made 0.7.1 release.

	* Fixed adler32 not to croak when (>= start end). Thanks to Edi
	Weitz via David Lichteblau.

2005-04-01  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* Made 0.7 release.

	* Made adler32 faster by working with the crc in two halves and
	only applying the mod every 16 rounds.

	* Fixed the buffer-offset declaration; array-total-size-limit and
	array-dimension-limit differ by a large margin on LispWorks, and
	they are exclusive bounds.

	* Exported zlib-stream-buffer.

	* Fixed declarations in (and slightly rearranged) the fixhash
	functions; fixhashes no longer segfault or fill up unexpectedly.

	* Added new octet-vector type and used it where appropriate.

2005-03-22  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* Made 0.6 release.

	* Very minor optimization declaration updates.

2005-03-20  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* Made 0.5 release

	* Changed declarations in many places; I mistakenly thought
	(simple-array foo) was the same as (simple-array foo (*)). It's
	not. Also added declarations where possible.

	* Changed bit-writing functions to close over simple-vectors of
	code and extra bits values, rather than packing things into a
	single integer.

	* Switched to a customized hash table implementation.

	* Switched to a customized implementation of REPLACE for octets.

	* Switched to LET binding instead of SYMBOL-MACROLET in a few places.

	* Switched to LOGAND and SHIFT in some places where LDB was used.

	* Switched to an (unsigned-byte 16) implementation of CRC32 to
	avoid bignums.
	
2005-03-17  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* Made 0.4 release.

	* zlib.lisp (compress-sequence): Fixed compress-string's interaction
	with the callback; removed the buggy assumption that all calls
	except the last will be on full buffers.

	* Made another silent 0.3 rerelease. How long can I go without
	anyone noticing?

	* zlib.lisp (compress-string): Changed call from ZLIB:COMPRESS to
	the newly-renamed ZLIB:COMPRESS-SEQUENCE.

2005-03-16  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* Silently re-release 0.3 with brown paper bag on head.

	* deflate-stream-interface.lisp (string-to-octets): Switch the
	order of START and END when calculating the size of the result
	sequence.

	* Made 0.3 release.

	* Renamed ZLIB:COMPRESS to ZLIB:COMPRESS-SEQUENCE.

	* Switched to a system of callbacks for handling full buffers; the
	condition system is used as a default if no callbacks are
	provided.

	* Added ZLIB:COMPRESS-STREAM.

	* Export ZLIB:ZLIB-STREAM-CALLBACK and
	DEFLATE:DEFLATE-STREAM-CALLBACK.

	* Fix embarrassing off-by-one error in DEFLATE::STRING-TO-OCTETS.

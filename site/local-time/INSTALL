Installation

1. Make sure the ASDF library is loaded.  In SBCL, this involves:

      (require :asdf)

2. Add the path to the directory containing local-time.asd to
   asdf:*central-registry*.  If you've installed this package using
   asdf-install, this shouldn't be necessary.

      (push "/my/local-time/directory/" asdf:*central-registry*)

3. Load local-time using ASDF:

      (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'local-time)

4. In your own projects, you can direct asdf to automatically load
   LOCAL-TIME with the :depends-on asdf:defsystem directive.

      (defsystem myproject
          :depends-on (local-time)
          ...)

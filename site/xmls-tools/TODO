The validation stuff is old code from when it was distributed as a
library called xmls-valid. It would be very nice to make validation
work via xml schemas rather than hand built rules. I've had some hacks
at this but kept getting stuck. So the validation stuff will stay as
useless as it is until I feel adequately motivated to make the schema
stuff work.

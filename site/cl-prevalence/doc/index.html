    <h1>CL-PREVALENCE</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
    CL-PREVALENCE is an implementation of <a href="http://www.prevayler.org">Object Prevalence</a> for Common Lisp.
    It was written by and is being maintained by <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/svc">Sven Van Caekenberghe</a>.
    CL-PREVALENCE is using <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/s-xml">S-XML</a> for the XML serialization 
    protocol (there is also a more Lisp-like s-expression-based serialization protocol).
  </p>

<p>
  Object Prevalence is a simple but interesting concept first proposed by Klaus Wuestefeld in 2001. 
  IBM developerWorks has a reasonable 
  <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-objprev/">Introduction to Object Prevalence</a> article. 
  The main Java implementation is called <a href="http://www.prevayler.org">Prevayler</a>, 
  with a (chaotic) wiki site with lots of information and discussions. 
  The following academic paper seems to describe the most essential features of Object Prevalence, without naming it as such:
  <a href="http://birrell.org/andrew/papers/024-DatabasesPaper.pdf">A Simple and Efficient Implementation for Small Databases</a>
  by Birrell, Jones, and Wobber [1987].  
  Basically, the idea is this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most databases are only a couple of hundreds of megabytes big, often even less.</li>
  <li>Most computers can easily take a couple of hundreds of megabytes of data in RAM, big servers can hold many gigabytes.</li>
  <li>Mapping objects to databases is at least tedious and time consuming, but often also complex and error prone.</li>
  <li>Let's throw away the database and just consider the domain model objects as the database.</li>
  <li>Let's make sure we can serialize and deserialize our objects to and from a some presistent medium such as a file system.</li>
  <li>If we store our complete set of domain model objects to a persistent medium we create a <em>snapshot</em>.</li>
  <li>We query by using the data structure manipulation functionality of our programming language, running from RAM, queries will be extremely fast.</li>
  <li>Let's agree to only change our object model using transaction objects that combine the data and the functionality to execute the transaction.</li>
  <li>In order to preserve the ACID properties of our system, we log each transaction to some persistent medium by serializing it after we execute it. The is called the <em>transaction log</em>.</li>
  <li>When the system goes down (intentionally or unintentionally) we restore its latest state by first reading in the latest snapshot and by re-executing each transaction from the transaction log.</li>
  <li>Transactions must be deterministic and re-entrant (so they also need to record the current time if necessary).</li>
  <li>In a multi-threaded system, transactions are globally serialized.</li>
</ul>
<p>
That is all there is to the concept of object prevalence. Here are some more details as well as some advantages and limitations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good implementation on a modern machine can achieve thousands of transactions per second, and recover them at about the same speed.</li>
  <li>Transactions must be short because they block the system - since everything is in RAM this is not a problem.</li>
  <li>Queries that need to see a completely consistent system state must also block on the system - other less critical queries could run in parallel.</li>
  <li>It is practical for a transaction to first check its preconditions, throw an error if necessary, and to only modify the system when everything is consistent. During a transaction you are the sole active thread. Queries are as fast as they can get. In this implementation transactions are logged after succesful execution.</li>
  <li>In this implementation there is an option to do a rollback (by doing a system restore) when an unexpected error occurs during transaction execution. You can specifiy that a condition doesn't need a rollback when it occurs inside a transaction by implementing the <tt>initiates-rollback</tt> to return false (or by using the <tt>no-rollback-error</tt> condition or inheriting from it).</li>
  <li>Long running transactions are an open question.</li>
  <li>Application server techniques are used to offer multiple clients access to the same prevalence system.</li>
  <li>We can easily do replication (and query load balancing) by distributing the master transaction log stream to replica's that can host queries, execute backups (snapshots) or serve as hot fail-over. This implementation does not yet contain replication.</li>
</ul>

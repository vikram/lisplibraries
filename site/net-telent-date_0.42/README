Most of the code in this package is parse-time.lisp, which was
originally written by Jim Healy in June 1987, and has been lifted
wholesale from CMUCL.

The rest of it is a few useful functions for printing dates in
standard(sic) formats.  See documentation strings for
universal-time-to-http-date, universal-time-to-rfc2822-date, dayname,
monthname.

Thanks to Kevin Rosenberg for bouncing ideas off, for the initial
universal-time-to-rfc2822-date implementation, and for Debian
packaging

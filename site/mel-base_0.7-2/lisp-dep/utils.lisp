(defmacro with-unique-names ((&rest bindings) &body body)
"
Syntax:
  WITH-UNIQUE-NAMES ({var | (var prefix)}*) declaration* form* => result* 
Description:
  Executes a series of forms with each var bound to a fresh,
  uninterned symbol. The uninterned symbol is created as if 
  by a call to gensym with the string denoted by prefix or,
  if prefix is not supplied, the string denoted by var as 
  argument.

  The variable bindings created are lexical unless special 
  declarations are specified.

  The forms are evaluated in order, and the values of all but
  the last are discarded (that is, the body is an implicit 
  progn).

(defmacro rebinding (bindings &body body)

Syntax:
  REBINDING ( { var | (var prefix) }* ) form*  =>  result

Description:
  Evaluates a series of forms in the lexical environment that is
  formed by adding the binding of each var to a fresh, uninterned
  symbol, and the binding of that fresh, uninterned symbol to var's
  original value, i.e., its value in the current lexical
  environment.

  The uninterned symbol is created as if by a call to GENSYM with
  the string denoted by prefix---or, if prefix is not supplied, the
  string denoted by var---as argument.

  The forms are evaluated in order, and the values of all but the
  last are discarded (that is, the body is an implicit progn).

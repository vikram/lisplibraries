MK:DEFSYSTEM 4.0

A re-implementation of an old idea.

INTRODUCTION

The package that you are looking at is a very preliminary version of
the code for DEFSYSTEM 4.0.  A backward compatible and extended
re-implementation of the original MK:DEFSYSTEM by Mark Kantrowitz's.

The system is now CLOS based.  The main design goals are

1 - MK:DEFSYSTEM backward compatibility
2 - Cleaner implementation of internal and external interfaces
3 - Extensibility
4 - Generality (i.e. cleaner provisions to specify external languages
    and compilers; Fortran and C being the main targets)

Some new features include (or rather will include)

1 - versioned dependencies
2 - specialized dependencies


COMMENT

As you may have noticed, I do not quite subscribe to the notion that
"simplicity" buys you much.  I believe that the interface should be
simple. The implementation should be "as simple as possible".  Of
course the current code can be cleaned up and simplified: I encourage
that.


STATUS

This code is highly experimental.  There are several areas where the
system will need a better design, e.g. the foreign language
manipulation facility.

Documentation is in a very poor state.

Please help to make the system meet all the stated goals.

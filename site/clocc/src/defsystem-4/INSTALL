INSTALL

DEFSYSTEM 4.0

This is the MK:DEFSYSTEM installation guide.

Since MK:DEFSYSTEM is a 'build' tool for Common Lisp, we cannot rely
on it to actually load and compile itself.  Moreover, starting from
release 4.0, MK:DEFSYSTEM comes split in several files, to ease its
maintenance and modification.  This caused a minor construction
headache.

To mitigate I provide a first cut "load-defsystem.lisp" file which
will load and compile the system.

Once you have done that, you simply need to start you favorite Common
Lisp, load the "load-defsystem.lisp" and see what happens.  I.e. you
should be able to just do

1 - Start your Common Lisp
2 - At the listener prompt

  I-am-the-CL-prompt> (load "load-defsystem.lisp")

Of course you may need to locate the file somewhere else in your file
system.
At this point you should be able to use MK:DEFSYSTEM in your system.

Please report any bugs and suggestions about the construction
procedure to Marco Antoniotti <marcoxa@cons.org>.

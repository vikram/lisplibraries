MK:DEFSYSTEM 4 Partial TODO List.

* Fix/Finish the specs and the documentation.

* Test basic program functionality.
  ** DEFSYSTEM maintains some state across operations.  This state
     should be made explicit and stored in a better way at the
     component level.
  ** The ``policies'' idea is not fleshed out.
  ** There may still be some problems w.r.t. pathnames (nothing new
     here).

* Advanced program functionality
  ** Foreign language integration is suboptimal.  More design is needed.

* Extension and Extensibility
  ** This needs more design. Essentially, the construction of new
     ``components'' is not thought out yet.
  ** Specialized dependencies and versions need to be tested and
     integrated in the design.

Union Find Simple.

This package contains a Common Lisp implementation of the well known
UNION-FIND data structure and algorithms.  It is based on the
description found in

1 - T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, and R. L. Rivest,
    "Introduction to Algorithms", Ch. 22, MIT Press, 1990.
2 - K. Melhorn, and S. N\"aher, "LEDA: A Platform for Combinatorial
    and Geometric Computing", Cambridge University Press, 1999.

The implementation manipulates "forests" representing disjoint sets.
The forests are organized in "partitions".

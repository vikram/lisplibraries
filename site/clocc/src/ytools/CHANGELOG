2005-06-17: Add feature pre-chunk, so that .lsy files can run under
            either old YTools or YTools 2. Added file
            multvalhacks.lisp. (Version 1.4.9)

2005-01-25: Add utility 'stream-indent' to outin.lisp            

2004-11-07: Resurrected 'intercept' and 'pass' with improved type
            checking.  Altered 'ytools-logical-pathname-def' so it
            returns a second argument (the 'obj-version' of the
            pathname) (Version 1.4.8.7)

2004-10-30: Changed output for warning message in 'decipher-readtable'
            (slurp.lisp). (Version 1.4.8.6)

2004-10-29: Wrapped #+openmcl around code referring to ccl
            package. (Version 1.4.8.5.)

2004-10-26: Fixed bug in outin whereby nonstreams were making it into
            the variable 'out-streams*' (probably because Allegro does
            something odd to streams when it closes them).  (Version
            1.4.8.4)

2004-10-05: One more tweak to logic of 'compilable' in
            lprec-check-compile. (Version 1.4.8.3)

2004-10-04: Fixed bugs introduced by fixes of 10-02. 
	    Added second value returned by
            'ytools-logical-pathname-def' (the bin directory)
	    (Version 1.4.8.2)

2004-10-02: Replaced 'lisp:' with 'cl:' in a couple of files.
            Stopped 'fload' from trying to compile files with types
            other than Lisp source. (Version 1.4.8)

2004-10-01: Define 'ytools-logical-pathname-def' to make it easy to
            find the definition of a YTools logical pathname. (Version 1.4.7)

2004-09-29: Added convenience function (in-ytools), which sets
            *package* and *readtable* to their proper YTools
            values. (Version 1.4.6)

2004-09-26: Patch 'subr-synonym' to cope with bug in OpenMCL.
            (Version 1.4.5)

2004-09-19: Define 'is-list' in base.lisp as synonym for 'listp'.
            Minor change to 'datafun-table' in datafun.lisp.

2004-09-16: Added field :initbind e to (x :in l) clause of
            'repeat'. The expression e is evaluated and bound to x
            initially.  This is purely to satisfy some compilers that
            complain if x is declared to be of some type incompatible
            with an initial value of nil.  (Version 1.4.4)

2004-09-11: Change 'ytools-module-load' in module.lisp so that
            expansion of module is evalualated when module is loaded.

2004-09-02: Replace 'assoc' with 'assq' in expansion of 'alist-entry'
            (to avoid confusing Nisp). (Version 1.4.3)

2004-08-22: Interaction between 'outin' and pretty-printer streamlined.
	
2004-08-11: Stuff after :proceed and :prompt-for is now a list of args
            suitable for 'out'.  In the case of :prompt-for, the last
	    element is the default, and the out-args don't include that
	    last element.
	
2004-08-09: Change in bq.lisp to allow other files to use its facilities.
	    Invisible to users.  Changed logic in 'fload' so after asking
	    whether to compile a previously uncompiled file it doesn't
	    consider loading old (nonexistent) object code.  (Version 1.4.2)
	
2004-08-06: Introduced :|| as prettier synonym for :\|
	
2004-08-03: Altered implementation of '!' dispatch macro; change
            invisible to users.  Another invisible change to
            subr-synonym (allows specification of numargs).
	
2004-07-30: Made ytdoc.pdf part of the CVS system, so it will be part of
            the "nightly snapshot."  (Version 1.4.1)
	
2004-07-25: Adding 'nthrest'
	
2004-07-10: Simplified Qvar as type	
	
2004-07-09: Added gen-var
	
2004-07-06: Tiny bug fix in setter
	
2004-06-25: Further enhancements to alref. .  Made packages work in
	    names of YTools logical pathnames.  Fixed bug in 'repeat'
	    for var notation (v e0 :then e1) so it's the same as (v =
	    e0 :then e1).  Got 'fload-recheck' working correctly.
	    Version 1.4
	
2004-06-24: Improved definition of 'alref.' so it allows specification
            of equality test, access method, and new-entry builder.
	    Allow package names to occur inside YTools logical pathnames.
	
2004-04-20: Added 'val-or-initialize' and its notational variant,
            'memoize-val', to misc.  Tightened definitions of 'alref' and
	    'alref.' .
	
2004-03-14: Added debug.lisp
	
2004-03-09: Changes for portability.
	
2003-12-17: (branch ytools-1-2-dev) Rejiggered logic to checking
	    whether to recompile in files.lisp.  Eventually this will be
	    right, by the monkeys-and-typewriters theorem.
	
2003-12-11: (branch ytools-1-2-dev) Rewrote file-update checker to get
            right the logic of when to recompile or reload a file.
	
2003-11-08: Slight change to an error message in pathname.lisp.
	
2003-10-28: Changed ytload.lisp to allow .lmd files to be in arbitrary places
	
2003-10-27: Eliminated Allegro check in depend.lisp"
	
2003-10-26: Added 'ytcopy.lisp' utility
	
2003-08-24: Declared var fload-compile* properly.
	    Better y-n query handling in one place
	    Still struggling with precise definition of 'depends-on'
	
2003-08-15: Slight reorganization of 'repeat.lisp' to split some local
	    functions off so they can be used elsewhere.
	
2003-08-14: Changed handling of datafuns on property lists, adding
            'datafun-on-plist'.
	    In mapper.lisp, had to explicitly declare that 'mapmac'
	    property is stored on symbol plists.  Ditto for 'match-code'
	    property in setter.lisp.
	    Slight bug fix in setter.lisp
	
2003-08-06: Fixed bug in pathname.lisp	    
	
2003-08-03: Added '--' to base.lisp
	
2003-07-13: Replaced :continue with :proceed in 'signal-problem'.  Made
            the string after :proceed evaluable.

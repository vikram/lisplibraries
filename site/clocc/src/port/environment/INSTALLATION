CL.ENVIRONMENT 1.2

Installation Instructions

===========================================================================
1. Without MK:DEFSYSTEM (preferred).

Load the file named 'load-cl-environment.lisp'.

      (load "load-cl-environment.lisp")

Be careful about the directory you are in and/or the actual location
of the aforementioned file.  The package is actually loaded from the
directory of *LOAD-TRUENAME* as bound by the call to LOAD.

You can skip the Section 1.1 and Section 2 and proceed to Section 3.

1.1 Utility function.

Once the file "load-cl-environment.lisp" is loaded you will have the
function CL-USER::LOAD-CL-ENVIRONMENT-LIBRARY at your disposal.  This
can be used for debugging and other purposes.  You can now issue.

      (cl-user::load-cl-environment-library
                :directory "/where/the/env/library/is/")

This will load the library.  To actually compile it, run

      (cl-user::load-cl-environment-library
                :directory "/where/the/env/library/is/"
                :compile-first-p t)

This will compile the files first and then load them.

You can skip Section 2.

===========================================================================
2. With MK:DEFSYSTEM.

You need MK:DEFSYSTEM to do everything automatically.  Just issue the
following commands.

      (load "/where/the/library/is/env.system")
      (mk:compile-system 'cl.environment)

This procedure is less tested.  The reason why the system file is not
recommended is that I consider CL-ENVIRONMENT a "lower level"
functionality than that provided by any "defsystem" utility.

===========================================================================
3. Test.

You are in business.  You can check the variables

      cl.env:*common-lisp-implementation*
      cl.env:*operating-system*
      cl.env:*machine*

They should be bound to a proper class instance.  Reloading the code
does not guarantee you to maintain the same instances (yet).

You can also try the function CL.ENV:SYSTEM-INFO to get a
comprehensive printout regarding your current CL session.

CL.EXT.CONFIGURATION 0.1

This package contains a set of definitions whose intent is to
facilitate the management of a system configuration, w.r.t. those
parameters which somewhat fall outside a DEFSYSTEM tool
jurisdiction.  In particular the DEFCONFIGURATION utility can be used
to set up in a relatively platform independent way a set of logical
pathname translations that can be used by the DEFSYTEM tool.

Please see the files INSTALLATION and COPYRIGHT for more information,
and refer to the documentation for a detailed description of the
CONF:DEFCONFIGURATION utility and the companion CONF:SETUP generic
function.

The package is currently released under the LGPL and all the files
should be considered to include such Copyright notice.

Summary:      Portable Code Profiling Tool

Version:      v2.1 (25-JAN-94)

Description: 

   METERING is a portable code profiling tool, for gathering timing and
   consing statistics while a program is running. This is a combination
   of the Monitor package written by Chris McConnell and the Profile
   package written by Skef Wholey and Rob MacLachlan, with several
   extensions.  Monitors the use of functions and macros: calls, CPU
   time, clock time, and storage use.

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        Portable, with three small implementation-dependent
              changes for new Common Lisp implementations. Tested in
              CMU CL, MACL, MCL, Allegro CL, Lucid CL, AKCL, IBCL.

This is a bunch of tests to test if a Common Lisp implementation
conforms to ANSI standard X3J13 for Common Lisp.

It is largely based on the clisp test-suite (last update 15 dec 2001),
examples from the HyperSpec and bugreports.

This is a work in progress.

Even though it's in the clocc package, the ansi-tests system
is a standalone system. It can run without having anything else
from clocc available; all you need is the ansi-test/ directory.

There is a Makefile that should sort-of-work, please look at it 
and adapt it to your situation.

To run the tests manually, start your Lisp in the ansi-test/ 
directory and type
(load "tests.lisp")
at the command prompt.

The tests produce output on the console, with failed tests
marked with "ERROR!!". They also produce error output files
with extensions ".erg", where every entry in such a file
is from a failed test. Thus, if ansi-test thinks your Lisp
is compliant, it will still produce a lot of output on the
console, but no "ERROR!!" messages; and it will produce
only empty ".erg" files (that should get deleted away).

These are the sources for the HTML version of the CLX manual and the
converter program used to generate it.

To regenerate the manual load 'run.lisp' and call '(run)', the manual
will then be generated to the 'clxman' directory. If you want to
generate different looking versions (e.g. a framed version) tweak the
DEFPARAMETERs near the head of clxman.lisp.

The sources of the manual itself can be found in the 'source'
directory, you'll find some additional notes in the head of the
clxman.sgml file.

Unfortunatly the code currently only runs with CMUCL, since it makes
use of EXT:RUN-PROGRAM.

The nifty index applet was written by Deliana Foutekova
<unjm@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de> and uses a clever kludge to load the index
in form of an '.class' file at run time. This '.class' file is
generated, which implies that you'll need a java compiler for
successful regeneration of the CLX Manual unless you turn the index
applet off, in which case the applet will be replaced by a boring link
to the manual's index.

Requirements: (working == demo/hello hello-world works)

- clisp version 2.28 or higher (earlier versions have pathname problems)
- acl (untested by the author)
- lwl (untested by the author)
- cmucl
- sbcl with db-sockets with notes:
  +  please do
      (pushnew :db-sockets *features*) 
     after loading db-sockets)
  + there is a problem with home: as logical pathname, please do:

(setf (logical-pathname-translations "home")
   '(("**;*.*.*" "/home/pvaneynd/**/*.*")
     (";**;*.*.*" "/home/pvaneynd/**/*.*")))

Problems with:

-lwl: I don't know how to open the unix socket
-acl: Didn't have time to download the newst and greatest version yet and
      my older licence expired :-(
  
How to compile and load clx without common-lisp-controller:

(load "compile-and-load")

To test:

(load "demo/hello")
(xlib::hello-world "")

With common-lisp-controller: (please note that the patches included in the clocc-port
subdirectory have not yet been send upstream, so the cvs and cclan version won't do)

Put the source in for example ~/common-lisp/src/clx and add the following to your
startup script ( ~/.sbclrc or ~/.cmucl-init.lisp)

|;;; -*- Mode: Lisp; Package: USER; Base: 10; Syntax: Common-Lisp -*-
|
|(load "/etc/sbclrc")
|
|(format t "Hello Peter!~%")
|  
|(common-lisp-controller:add-project-directory
| #p"/home/pvaneynd/common-lisp/src/"
| #p"/home/pvaneynd/common-lisp/fasl-sbcl/"
| '("CLX")
| "/home/pvaneynd/common-lisp/systems/")

then you can do: 

* (require :db-sockets)
* (pushnew :db-sockets *features*)
* (require :clocc-port)
* (mk:oos :clx :compile)
* (mk:oos :clx :load)

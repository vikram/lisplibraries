Welcome to CLUE and its  companion systems!  Included are  the following
subdirectories.


    clue/clue

        The Common Lisp User Interface Environment (CLUE) is a  portable
        system for  user  interface  programming  in Common Lisp.  CLUE,
        which is based on the X Window System and the Common Lisp Object
        System  (CLOS),  extends  the   CLX  interface  to   provide  an
        architectural model  for  the  construction  of interactive Lisp
        applications.  Modelled on the Xt toolkit library, CLUE could be
        described as  a  translation  of  the  Xt  "intrinsics" into the
        domain of Common Lisp and CLOS.

    clue/clio
        
        Common Lisp Interactive Objects (CLIO) is a set of CLOS  classes
        that represent  the  standard  components  of an object-oriented
        user interface --- such as  text, menus, buttons, scroller,  and
        dialogs.  CLIO is designed  to be a  portable system written  in
        Common Lisp and based on CLX, CLUE, and CLOS.  CLIO specifies an
        application progam interface that is look-and-feel  independent.
        That is, the  look-and-feel of  CLIO components  is encapsulated
        within the  implementation  of  the  CLIO  interface.   A sample
        implementation for OPEN LOOK (TM AT&T) is provided.

    clue/pictures

        Pictures is an  object-oriented graphics  package built  on CLX,
        CLUE,  and  CLOS.   Pictures  provides  a  set  of  classes  for
        creating,  transforming,  and   interacting  with   hierarchical
        structures of 2D graphical primitives.

Related Systems
    
    Pictures relies upon three other systems --- CLX, CLUE and CLOS.

    CLUE, the Common Lisp  User interface Environment,  may be found  in
    the X11 distribution from MIT.

    CLX,  the  Common  Lisp  X  Interface,  may  be  found  in  the  X11
    distribution from MIT (see lib/CLX/*).

    CLOS, the Common Lisp Object  System, is a draft  standard extension
    to ANSI  Common  Lisp  for  object-oriented  programming.  Xerox PCL
    (Portable Common  Loops)  is  an  implementation  of  CLOS  which is
    available  publicly   at   no   cost   by   sending   a  request  to
    CommonLoops.pa@xerox.com.  Sources for a simple implementation of  a
    CLOS subset called  Clos-Kludge are  included in  the CLUE directory
    (see clue/clos-kludge/*).  Clos-Kludge is sufficient for simple CLUE
    programming, but it is neither supported nor recommended.
 


Installation

    Use the function load-pictures in the file picturs/defsystem.l.



Examples

    Two sets of examples  are provided to  demonstrate the use  of PICTURES.
    See the directory pictures/examples/*.

    pictures/examples/road-demo is a program  that creates a  picture of
    car.  Animation will occur by depressing control-a.

    The file view-zoom, in  the /pictures/source/ directory,  gives some
    example code on how to zoom in and out of a view.  These view action
    commands are  not  documented  but  they  are  used in the road-demo
    example.

    The file view-pan,  in the  /pictures/source/ directory,  gives some
    example code on how to pan  a view.  These view action  commands are
    not documented but they are used in the road-demo example.


Documentation

    The directory pictures/doc/*  contains several  documents describing
    pictures.

    pictures.rtf

        This is in the Microsoft Rich Text Format.  It was created using
        Word 4.0 on a Macintosh.

    pictures.text
 
        This is the text form the pictures.rtf file.  It can be  printed
        on a line printer.

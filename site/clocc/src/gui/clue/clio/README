Related Systems

    CLIO relies upon three other systems --- CLX, CLUE, and CLOS.

    CLX,  the  Common  Lisp  X  Interface,  may  be  found  in  the  X11
    distribution from  MIT  (see  lib/CLX/*).   CLIO  requires R3 CLX or
    later. CLX R4.2 or later is preferred.

    CLUE, the Common Lisp  User Interface Environment,  may be found  in
    the X11 distribution from  MIT (see contrib/toolkits/clue/*).   CLIO
    requires CLUE 7.20 (July 1990) or later.

    CLOS, the Common Lisp Object  System, is a draft  standard extension
    to ANSI  Common  Lisp  for  object-oriented  programming.  Xerox PCL
    (Portable Common  Loops)  is  an  implementation  of  CLOS  which is
    available  publicly   at   no   cost   by   sending   a  request  to
    CommonLoops.pa@xerox.com.  
 


Installation

    Use the  function  load-clio  in  the  file  clio/defsystem.l.   For
    Explorer users, this file also  contains a defsystem definition,  so
    that CLIO can be built via (make-system 'clio).



Examples

    A simple example program is provided to demonstrate the use of CLIO.
    See   the    directory    clio/examples/*.     Use    the   function
    load-clio-examples  in  the  file  clio/examples/defsystem.l.    For
    Explorer users, this file also  contains a defsystem definition,  so
    that CLIO examples can be built via (make-system 'clio-examples).

    The example, a simple graphics editor, is run using the function
    clio-examples:sketch.


Documentation

    The directory clio/doc/* contains several documents describing CLIO.

    CLIO.PS, CLIO.TEX

        The CLIO specification which  defines all CLIO  features.  LaTeX
        and PostScript versions are included.

    RELEASE.<release#>

        Release notes for  the current  and previous  versions of  CLIO.
        The highest <release#> identifies the version of the software in
        these  directories.    The   release   notes  contain  important
        information which must be read before using CLIO.

    TEXT-CMDS.TEXT

        This document discusses  user operations  for text  manipulation
        provided by the  implementation in  CLIO Version  1.0, which are
        generally consistent with  Level 1  of the  OPEN LOOK  Graphical
        User Interface and Style Guide.

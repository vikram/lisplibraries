;;; These tests will (as of March 2008) fail horribly on
;;;   * BDB without deadlock detection enabled.
;;;   * CLSQL/SQLite
;;;   * Probably other CLSQL backends
;;;
;;; The Postmodern backend should handle them correctly,
;;; and BDB as well (although I noticed a major slowdown).
;;;

;;; These tests imply quite strict levels of atomicity and transaction isolation:
;;; in no way concurrent transactions should affect each other, and in no way information
;;; should be lost due to concurrent updates.

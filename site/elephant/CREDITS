The CL-SQL based backend was written by Robert L. Read.

Thanks to:

Sleepycat for Berkeley DB, especially Ron Cohen and Michael
Cahill for answering my questions

Kevin Rosenberg for UFFI, answering lots of questions and
letting me patch

Gary Byers for OpenMCL and answering my questions

Richard Waters (and Paul Dietz, Kevin Rosenberg) for RT

Rafal Strzalinski for the Makefile and package patch

Bill Clementson for Win32 help and for publicity

The common-lisp.net people for hosting

The CMUCL and SBCL people for great compilers

SLIME for a better environment

Erik Enge (CL-IRC) for being an unwitting guinea pig

Dan Barlow for ASDF

IBM for ICU

Paul Foley for his berkeley-db package (which we didn't use,
once we settled on UFFI)

Dan Knapp fixed the fact that nil's were indistinguishable from
unbound slots, and proved the system works with SQLite3.

Tayssir John Gabbour has found two bugs on Feb. 14, 2006.

Ian Eslick wrote src/indexing.lisp, which added major convenience
features for automatically indexing on slot values in a class.  He is
also responsible for the refactoring and most of the bug fixes in the
0.6.0 release.

Vladimir Sedach for the upgrade to Berkeley DB 4.4.

pinterface@gmail.com provided the basic support in the .asd
files for removing the Makefile from the build process.

Marco Baringer provided a partial patch for 64-bit support.

Pierre Thierry for a *features* hack to turn off optimization as well as
many suggestions and dicussions.

Henrik Hjelte for a number of bug fixes and for testing as well as
his wonderful postmodern data store!

Edi Weisz for Lispwork and Win32 patches

Mac Chan for his Hutchentoot blog tutorial 

And many others for their comments, testing and suggestions -- we're sorry
if we missed crediting you here.

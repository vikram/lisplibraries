This directory contains a quick and dirty sketch of an allegrocache
backend, mostly to test out the new backend abstraction.  

Basic btrees work fine but iteration (cursors) are very limited.
I think the best way to go is reverse engineer the db.btree API
and just implement the elephant backend on top of that API.  I
may do this at some point, but not today...

Or better yet, find someone willing to write a btree library in
lisp.  John Fedaro said it wasn't a huge amount of work and can
be done with very high performance in all Common Lisp.

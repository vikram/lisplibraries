April, 2006 - Elephant 0.6.0 released by 
Robert Read and Ian Eslick.  Supports class slot
indexing and benefits from a clean refactoring
of backends and a host of other small changes.
This is a solid BETA release.

November 30, 2005 - Elephant 0.3.0 released by
the new maintainer, Robert L. Read, providing 
support for relational database backends, repository
migration, and multi-repository operation.

As of this release, the documentation provides a
lot of information about installation and getting 
things working; I wouldn't at all claim that it 
is complete, smooth, or well organized.  The more 
notes I get about the use of Elephant, the more 
inclined I will be to invest time in improving 
the documentation.

October 7, 2004 - 

Elephant 0.2.1 released.  Thanks to Bill Clementson,
Elephant should compile on Win32 now.  Also, a few minor
fixups.

September 19, 2004 -

Elephant 0.2 released.  This is an BETA release.

New features:

- Secondary indices and cursors
- PPC Darwin OpenMCL / SBCL
- Doc strings and improved documentation
- An RT-based test suite
- many bugfixes

This release has been tested on CMUCL 19a, SBCL 0.8.14 and
Allegro 6.2 on x86 Linux and FreeBSD, and OpenMCL 0.14.2-p1
and SBCL 0.8.14 on PPC Darwin.

September 2, 2004 -

The bad news: there was a bug in 0.1 which made OID
generation inside of manual transactions deadlock.

The good news: this is fixed, and I've added OpenMCL
support.  So I'm releasing 0.1-p1.

August 30, 2004 - 

Elephant 0.1 was released August 30th, 2004.  This is an
ALPHA quality release, so claims about correctness,
performance and safety should be taken with a grain of salt.
This release has been tested on CMUCL 19a, SBCL 0.8.13 and
Allegro 6.2 on x86 Linux and FreeBSD.  OpenMCL and Lispworks
versions will come soon.  As a proof of concept I've
compiled and run CL-IRC

making all objects and slots persistent, except for the
socket-streams.  It runs, and saves everything except for
the socket-streams.

The organization of the new Elephant is as follows:

Top directory contains:
- A binary object serialization framework (serializer.lisp)
- Code necessary to support different platform MOPs 
  (to move to closer-to-MOP in 0.6.1) (cmu/openmcl-mop-patches.lisp)
- Top level transaction model (transaction.lisp)
- An environment model for 'current store' and multi-repository operation (controller.lisp)
- The metaclass protocol for supporting persistent objects (metaclass.lisp, classes.lisp)
- Interface specs for persistent btrees & cursors (collections.lisp)
- Indexing support for the metaclass (indexing.lisp, index-utils.lisp)

Backends provide support for:
- A store controller w/ a persistent root index (*-controller.lisp)
  - Includes support for slot operations in metaclass protocol
- Collections defined via the specific controller (*-collections.lisp)
- Transactions specific to the backend (*-transactions.lisp)

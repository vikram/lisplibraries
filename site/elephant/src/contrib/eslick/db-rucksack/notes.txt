Three main approaches:

1) Adapt elephant to support either RS or existing metaobject models 
   (hard to migrate?)
2) Create a single RS persistent-class to store slot values for an
   elephant p-obj, borrow the rest of the mechanism (PROPOSAL)
3) Write our own lisp backend using the heap, cache and btree code?
   Depends on how deeply the cache is integrated with serializer, etc.

;; =============================
;;  CLASS / DB SYNCHRONIZATION
;; =============================

;; TO READER:  I got really tired of trying to figure out all
;; the messy conditionals and I figure default behaviors are something
;; others might want to modify, so here's what determines the rule 
;; behavior..
;; 
;; Rules match on the following states of the metaclass and current
;; database class-index for each slotname currently in either of
;; those sources.  Actions are taken, typically when a slot exists
;; in one but not the other or features like indexed/persistent 
;; differ between the slots
;; 
;; class state:
;;   class-indexed - the slot is marked as indexed
;;   class-persistent - the slot is marked as persistent (not indexed)
;;   class-transient - the slot is marked transient
;;   class-derived - the slot is in the derived list of the class
;;
;; database
;;   db-slot - the database has a slot index
;;   db-derived - the database has a derived index
;;
;; The inversions of any of these terms are also available as
;; (not indexed-slot) for example, to cover more than one feature 
;; combination
;;
;; Each rule should apply uniquely to a given feature set.
;;
;; Actions taken when rules match can include:
;;
;; add-slot-index - add a new index with the slotname to the db
;; remove-slot-index - remove a slot with the slotname from the db
;; add-derived-index - xxx this makes no sense! xxx
;; remove-derived-index - remove a derived index from the db
;; unregister-indexed-slot - remove an indexed slot from the class metaobject
;; unregister-derived - remove a derived index from the class metaobject
;; register-indexed-slot - register a slot with the class metaobject
;; register-derived-index - register a derived index with the class metaobject

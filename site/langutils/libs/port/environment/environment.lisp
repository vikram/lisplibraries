  "The VERSION-CASE macro executes forms depending on the ITEM version.
The macro works as the *CASE Common Lisp forms (e.g. TYPECASE). The
macro is used as

     (CL.ENV:VERSION-CASE (<item>)
        (<version discriminant> <form>*)*)

where each <version discriminant> is either a string or a list of
strings.  The forms in first clause that 'matches' the version (currently the
test is done via STRING-EQUAL) are executed and the value(s) of the
last form executed is (are) returned.

This macro is provided because there is not easy and/or clear way to
provide an 'objectified' version denotation. Hence CLOS dispatching
cannot be used on version strings."

CL.EXT.CONFIGURATION 0.1

Installation Instructions

1. Loading and compiling.

1a. Without MK:DEFSYSTEM.

Load the file named 'load-cl-configuration.lisp'.

      (load "load-cl-configuration.lisp")

Be careful about the directory you are in and/or the actual location
of the aforementioned file.

Once the file is loaded you will have the function
LOAD-CL-CONFIGURATION-LIBRARY at your disposal (it loaded in *PACKAGE*).
You can now issue.

      (load-cl-configuration-library :directory "/where/is/the/conf/library/")

This will load the library.  To actually compile it, run

      (load-cl-configuration-library :directory "/where/is/the/conf/library/"
                                     :compile-first-p t)

This will compile the files first and then load them.

Non UNIX implementations should be able to change the pathnames
appropriately.


1b. With MK:DEFSYSTEM.

You will need MK:DEFSYSTEM to set up the CL.EXT.CONFIGURATION package.  The
system should work only on CMUCL (and maybe Allegro).

Before doing anything, you will need to edit (sorry) the 'env.system'
file in order to have the correct :SOURCE-PATHNAME and
:BINARY-PATHNAME in place.

Start a CL *in the 'configuration' directory* and do

      (load "defconf.system")
      (mk:compile-system 'cl.ext.configuration)



2. Test.

You are in business.
You can now try to load (in the 'configuration' directory) the file
"defconf.conf" (of course you are doing this backward w.r.t. normal
operation) and issue the CONF:SETUP command.

	(load "defconf.conf")
	(conf:setup 'cl.ext.configuration)

This should print a set of logical pathname translations. The file
distributed is very simple, and the translations (for
"CL.EXT.CONFIGURATION") should look like

	(("**;*.*.*" "/where/your/current/directory/is/**/")
         ("**;*.*" "/where/your/current/directory/is/**/")
         ("*.*.*" "/where/your/current/directory/is/"))

under UNIX, and 

	(("**;*.*.*" "X:\\where\\your\\current\\directory\\is\\**\\")
         ("**;*.*" "X:\\where\\your\\current\\directory\\is\\**\\")
         ("*.*.*" "X:\\where\\your\\current\\directory\\is\\"))

under Windows. On a Mac running MCL, or on Genera it should look like

	(("**;*.*.*" ":where:your:current:directory:is:**:")
         ("**;*.*" ":where:your:current:directory:is:**:")
         ("*.*.*" ":where:your:current:directory:is:"))

	(("**;*.*.*" ">where>your>current>directory>is>**>")
         ("**;*.*" ">where>your>current>directory>is>**>")
         ("*.*.*" ">where>your>current>directory>is>"))

But I did not have any chances to try it out.

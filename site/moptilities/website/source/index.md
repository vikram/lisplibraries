### What it is

Like several other projects on Common-Lisp.net, Moptilities provides a compatibility layer for minor MOP implementation differences. More importantly, it adds some handy reflection capabilities. [TINAA][8] documentation is [available][9].

### Mailing Lists

Moptilities has a single mailing list:

  * [moptilities-devel][]: A list for questions, patches, bug reports, and so on; It's for everything other than    
  
{anchor downloads}

A [Darcs][] repository is available. The commands are listed below:

       darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/moptilities

Moptilities is [ASDF installable][12]. Its CLiki home is right [where][13] you'd expect.

There's also a handy [gzipped tar file][14].

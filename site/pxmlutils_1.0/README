This is Franz's LLGPL xmlutils package modified to work under other
Common Lisp implementations. It depends on ACL-COMPAT.

The HTML parser works fine.

The XML parser works but:

1) Unicode support has been removed. This was done by brutally
   redefining unicode-check to do nothing. The consequences of this
   change are as yet untested.

2) Not a great deal of testing has been done.

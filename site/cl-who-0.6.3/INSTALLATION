Installation of CL-WHO

1. Probably the easiest way is

     (load "/path/to/cl-who/load.lisp")

   This should compile and load CL-WHO on most Common Lisp
   implementations.

2. With MK:DEFSYSTEM you can make a symlink from 'cl-who.system'
   to your central registry and then issue the command

     (mk:compile-system "cl-who")

   Note that this relies on TRUENAME returning the original file a
   symbolic link is pointing to. With AllegroCL 6.2 this will only
   work if you've applied all patches with (SYS:UPDATE-ALLEGRO).

3. You can also use ASDF instead of MK:DEFSYSTEM in a similar way:

     (asdf:operate 'asdf:compile-op :cl-who)
     (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :cl-who)

Complete documentation for CL-WHO can be found in the 'doc'
directory.

CL-WHO also supports Nikodemus Siivola's HYPERDOC, see
<http://common-lisp.net/project/hyperdoc/> and

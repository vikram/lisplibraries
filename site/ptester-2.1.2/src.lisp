test.  `test-form' is a form that will produce the value to be compared to
the expected-value.  If the values are not the same, then an error is
logged, otherwise a success is logged.

Normally the comparison of values is done with `eql'.  The `test' keyword
argument can be used to specify other comparison functions, such as eq,
equal,equalp, string=, string-equal, etc.

Normally, only the first return value from the test-form is considered,
however if `multiple-values' is t, then all values returned from test-form
are considered.

`fail-info' allows more information to be printed with a test failure.

`known-failure' marks the test as a known failure.  This allows for
programs that do regression analysis on the output from a test run to
discriminate on new versus known failures."

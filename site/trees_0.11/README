This package implements binary trees of various kinds, presenting a
uniform interface to them all.  Reading package.lisp should give you an
idea of what sorts of things you can do to trees and reading
binary-trees.lisp and generics.lisp provides a slightly more in-depth
look at the functions you would want to use.

There is a moderately extensive test suite which one can run with
(ASDF:OOS 'ASDF:TEST-OP :TREES).  Please be aware that it does take a
bit of time to run.  If any tests fail, you have found a bug; please
report it.

Report any bugs, comments, or improvements to <froydnj@gmail.com>.

Changes
-------

 version 0.1.3 - 2007-03-14

  - fixed paths:filter-distinct to better choose knots to keep (really
    eliminating zero length interpolation.)

  - extended cl-aa protocol to provide a way to sweep only a
    rectangular zone of the resulting state. (New functions are
    freeze-state, scanline-sweep, scanline-y and
    cells-sweep/rectangle.)

  - added a version of cl-aa specialized for rendering non-antialiased
    polygon, named aa-bin and included in the cl-aa system definition.

 version 0.1.2 - 2007-03-08

  - fixed make-circle-path. A bug prevented circle creation with non
    positive coordinates. Also, the circle path doesn't include the
    zero-length straight line anymore (it was here for historical
    reason.)

  - fixed dash transformation when processing arcs. The resultings
    chunk of arcs were not correctly specified for the :large-arc-flag
    attribute (it was false all the time.)

  - vectors:update-state now accept either a path or a list of paths.

 version 0.1.1 - 2007-03-06

  - fixed cl-aa.asd system definition ("cl-aa" -> "aa").
    Thanks to Ivan Toshkov.

 version 0.1 - 2007-03-06

  - Initial release.

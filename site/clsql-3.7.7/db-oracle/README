This is the header of the cadabra source file.

;;;; The original version of this code was copyright (c) 1999-2000 Cadabra Inc.
;;;; It was placed in the public domain by Cadabra in January 2000.

;;;; The implementors of the original version were Winton Davies
;;;; <wdavies@cadabra.com> and William Newman <william.newman@airmail.net>.

;;;; known issues:
;;;;   * The code will leak C resources if errors occur in the the wrong
;;;;     places, since it doesn't wrap its allocation/deallocation
;;;;     logic in the necessary EVAL-WHENs to prevent this. (This could be
;;;;     easily be an issue for long-running processes which recover from
;;;;     database errors instead of simply terminating when they occur. It's
;;;;     not an issue for programs which consider database errors so abnormal
;;;;     that they die immediately when they encounter one.)
;;;;   * Instead of reading Oracle header files automatically, this code
;;;;     uses constants, types, and function signatures manually transcribed
;;;;     from the Oracle header files. Thus, changes in the header files
;;;;     may require manual maintenance of the code. (This version was written
;;;;     for Oracle 8.1.5.)

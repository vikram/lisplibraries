DOCUMENTATION TO DO LIST

1. Variances from CommonSQL (Ideally, this will be extremely minimal) 

2. Underdocumented CommonSQL features:

 - Retrieval immediate
 - SQL operators: ||, SUBSTR, MINUS, INTERSECT, UNION, NVL 

3. CLSQL extensions to CommonSQL

 - SQL operators: group-by, limit, not-null, ==, is, having, the, uplike,
   view-class, coalesce, except, exists, substring, concat 

 - SELECT: additional keyword arguments accepted include :INNER-JOIN and :ON. 

4. Documenting lower level, non-CommonSQL functions (some of this is already 
   done). 

 - connection pools
 - database-query-result-set 
 
5. Notes on any peculiarities of each of the backends (e.g., unsupported 
   features, notable extensions etc.). 

 - MYSQL 
 - SQLITE 
 - ODBC 
-  ORACLE

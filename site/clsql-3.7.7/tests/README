* RUNNING THE REGRESSION SUITE

This test suite looks for a configuration file named
".clsql-test.config" located in the users home directory. This file
contains a single assoc-list that specifies the connection specs for
each database type to be tested. There is an example file in
contained in CLSQL's examples directory.

These tests require the downloading of the rt package from
http://files.b9.com/.

Load clsql.asd or put it somewhere where ASDF can find it
and call:

(asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'clsql)

The test suite will then automatically run on all of the backends that
you have defined in .clsql-test.config

* REGRESSION TEST SUITE GOALS

The intent of this test suite is to provide sufficient coverage for
the system to support the following:

** Refactoring and Redesign of particular subsystems

Refactoring and redesign efforts are normally restricted to a single
subsystem, or perhaps to interdependent subsystems.  In such cases, a
set of regression tests which excercise the existing interface of the
rest of CLSQL to the changing subsystems should be in place and passing
before the coding starts.

** Ensuring portability and Supporting new ports.

The more coverage the test suite provides the easier portability is to
maintain, particularly if we have instances of the test suite running
against the head on the supporting lisp environment/OS/hardware/DBMS
combinations.  Since no individual within the project has the ability
to run all of those combinations themselves, we are dependent upon some
informal coordination between the mintainers of the various ports.

** Adding new RDBMS backends

The entire CLSQL DBMS interface needs to be excercised by the test
suite, such that a new RDBMS backend that passes all the tests can be
reasonably assured of working with the CLSQL layers above that.  These
tests should also serve as impromptu documentation for the details of
that interface and what it expects frothe RDBMS driver layers.

** Bug identification and QA

As new bugs are identified, they should have a regression test written
which excercises them. This is to ensue that we donot start
backtracking. These tests by theselves are also very valuable for
developers, so even if you cannot fix a bug yourself, providing a
testto excercise it greatly reduces the amount of timea developer must
spend finding the bug prior to fixing it.


* TEST DESIGN ISSUES

** Multiple RDBMS Issues

CLSQL supports several RDBMS backends, and it should be possible to run
every test against all of them.  However, there are some features
which we want tests for but which are not implemented on several of
the backends.  

** Test Hygiene

Tests should be able to be run multiple times against the same
database.  It is also important that they clean up after themselves
when they create tables, sequences or other pesistent entities in the
RDBMS backends, because often there are limits to the number of those
thatcan exist at one time, and it also makes debuging thru the SQL
monitors difficult when there aretons of unused tables lying around.

If test need to load large datasets, they should have a mechanism to
ensure the dataset is loaded just once, and not with every test run.

Lastly, because there are various idiosyncracies with RDBMSs, please
ensure that you run the entire test suite once when you write your
tests, to ensure that your test does not leave some state behind which
causes other tests to fail.

** Test Run Configuration

The file test-init.lisp defines several variables which can be used to
control the connection dictionary of the database against which tests
will be run.  


* DATABASE CONNECTIONS/LIFECYCLE

** CreateDB
   *** Without existing DB
   *** With existing DB and use old
   *** With existing DB and use new
   *** Error if existing DB

      tables with all supported types of fields.
  *** Delete Tables/Views/Sequences/Indexes
  *** Inspection of Tables and attributes, including types

** Data Manipulation
  *** Update
  *** Insert
  *** Delete
  *** Query

** Functional Interface
  *** Creation/Modification of SQL expressions
  *** Querying

** Embedded SQL syntax
  *** Excercise all sql operators
  
** Object Interface

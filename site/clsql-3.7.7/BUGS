1. SBCL/Postgresql Interaction

Gabor Melis reported an interaction with SBCL and the postgresql
database backend using a multithreaded program and Portable
AllegroServe. It appears that libpg installs its own SIGPIPE
handler. When a multithreaded program servicing socket requests has
SIGPIPE conditions thrown, the running SBCL instance is killed.  The
web page http://linux.com.hk/docs/postgresql/libpq-threading.html has
more information about libpq's SIGPIPE handler.

2. Object joining

Aleksandar Bakic reported the documentation says that :home-key and
:foreign-key properties of the :db-info property may contain lists of
symbols. However, update-objects-joins fails in such cases.

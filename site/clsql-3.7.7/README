CLSQL is a Common Lisp to SQL engine interface by Kevin M.
Rosenberg. It includes both functional and object oriented subsystems
for data definition and manipulation as well as an integrated symbolic
SQL syntax.

CLSQL supports a number of RDBMS and uses the UFFI (http://uffi.b9.com) 
library for compatibility with Allegro CL, Lispworks, CMUCL, SBCL and
OpenMCL.

CLSQL has incorporated code from the following projects. At this point
in 2004, development of has stopped on these incorporated projects.
  - Pierre Mai's MaiSQL
  - onShore Development's UncommonSQL
  - Paul Meurer's SQL/ODBC 
  - Cadabra's Oracle interface

CLSQL's home is http://clsql.b9.com.

Documentation is available as a PDF file in doc/clsql.pdf and as HTML
files in doc/html.tar.gz.

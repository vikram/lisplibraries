  "Creates a View Class called CLASS whose slots SLOTS can map
onto the attributes of a table in a database. If SUPERS is nil
then the superclass of CLASS will be STANDARD-DB-OBJECT,
otherwise SUPERS is a list of superclasses for CLASS which must
include STANDARD-DB-OBJECT or a descendent of this class. The
syntax of DEFCLASS is extended through the addition of a class
option :base-table which defines the database table onto which
the View Class maps and which defaults to CLASS. The DEFCLASS
syntax is also extended through additional slot
options. The :db-kind slot option specifies the kind of DB
mapping which is performed for this slot and defaults to :base
which indicates that the slot maps to an ordinary column of the
database table. A :db-kind value of :key indicates that this slot
is a special kind of :base slot which maps onto a column which is
one of the unique keys for the database table, the value :join
indicates this slot represents a join onto another View Class
which contains View Class objects, and the value :virtual
indicates a standard CLOS slot which does not map onto columns of
the database table. If a slot is specified with :db-kind :join,
the slot option :db-info contains a list which specifies the
nature of the join. For slots of :db-kind :base or :key,
the :type slot option has a special interpretation such that Lisp
types, such as string, integer and float are automatically
converted into appropriate SQL types for the column onto which
the slot maps. This behaviour may be over-ridden using
the :db-type slot option which is a string specifying the
vendor-specific database type for this slot's column definition
in the database. The :column slot option specifies the name of
the SQL column which the slot maps onto, if :db-kind is
not :virtual, and defaults to the slot name. The :void-value slot
option specifies the value to store if the SQL value is NULL and
defaults to NIL. The :db-constraints slot option is a string
representing an SQL table constraint expression or a list of such
strings."

Hi Jeremy,<br>
<br>
I incorporated your edits and some more documentation. It is all in the
tarball I have attached. Please treat it as the current version.<br>
<br>
Here's the current state of things:<br>
<br>
-- pythononlisp does NOT asdf-install on SBCL 0.9.11, OSX/intel<br>
<br>
I suspect this has nothing to do with pythononlisp, and everything to
do with the immaturity of SBCL and cffi on OSX/intel, so this should be
ignored.<br>
<br>
-- pythononlisp does not asdf-install on cmucl Debian.<br>
<br>
I think this is just a small matter of getting the right
define-foreign-library form for Linux. One of the cffi guys should be
able to solve this very quickly, so I am ignoring it.<br>
<br>
-- pythononlisp DOES asdf-install without errors on SBCL 0.97, OSX/ppc<br>
<br>
It installs but it still doesn't work. When you try to run (py::py
"print \""Hello world\""), you get a stacktrace with the following
message:<br>
<br>
The value "Hello world" is not of type SYSTEM-AREA-POINTER. [Condition
of type TYPE-ERROR].<br>
<br>
The good news is, this means the Python print statement is in fact
being processed correctly. This is further than I have gotten so far.
The bad news is that it's output is not being returned out correctly.
The error suggests to me that somewhere within the function PYTHONLISP,
a function is expecting a pointer to a foreign string but that foreign
string has already been converted into a valid Lisp string.<br>
<br>
Within the doc/ directory in the tarball, I've added a subdirectory
debuglog. It contains subdirectories meant to be write-only stores for
recording stacktrace and debugging scripts. I enclose the entire
stacktrace of the error in one of those subdirectories, along with this
email.<br>
<br>
If you have a clue about how to fix this problem quickly, I'm happy to
test it. However, next Tuesday I'll be leaving for about a month, so if
you don't think we're likely to resolve this problem quickly I suggest
we put the tarball that I am sending you online, post a note to
cl-gardeners, and hope that more expert hands will take this the rest
of the way.<br>
<br>
Hopefully someone will pick it up. It baffles me to think that so many
folks are busily reproducing rather primitive libraries, when this
single project alone -- if it could be made to work well -- would
effectively introduces HUNDREDS of excellent libraries in one stroke.
But we've talked about this before<br>
<br>
all the best,<br>

&gt;&gt; I didn't know you were going to have a go at installing it
yourself.<br>
&gt;&gt; (I only knew my constant flight from the spammers was
scrambling some<br>
&gt;&gt; of my addresses) Good luck!<br>

&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Here it is! I simply moved the Python DLL definitions to the top
so they<br>
&gt; are initialised before defpyfun is called. Now it compiles. It
would be<br>
&gt; great if you could test this (load it as an ASDF in other words)
and<br>
&gt; tell me how it goes.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I also fixed a bug in dumpstd where it was using pygetarg *inside*
a<br>
&gt; defpyfun! Not a good idea as the string has already been converted
and<br>
&gt; thus is not a pointer! Which meant that get-web-page was broken.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Once you've looked it over for any problems (shouldn't take 5
minutes),<br>
&gt; give me the go-ahead and I'll put it in the tar.gz with an update
to the<br>
&gt; docs to say it compiles okay, and works fine. Then maybe people
will use<br>
&gt; it!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Cheers,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Jeremy.<br>

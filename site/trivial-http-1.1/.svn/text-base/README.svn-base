trivial-http is a trivial library for doing HTTP POST and GET over a
socket interface. It establishes a package TRIVIAL-HTTP, also called
THTTP, from which the following functions are exported:

(THTTP:HTTP-GET URL) - returns a list of three elements: a response
code as integer, an association list of headers returned from the
server, and a stream from which the request can be read.

(THTTP:HTTP-POST URL CONTENT-TYPE CONTENT) - given a URL, a MIME
content type, and the content as a character stream, POST to the URL
and return the list of three elements as described for HTTP-GET.

(THTTP:ESCAPE-URL-QUERY QUERY) - escapes a query string in accordance
with the HTTP specification.

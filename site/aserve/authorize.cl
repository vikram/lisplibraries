;; location authorization
;; we allow access based on where the request is made from.
;; the pattern list is a list of items to match against the
;; ip address of the request.  When the first match is made the
;; request is either accepted or denied.
;;
;; the possible items in the list of patterns
;;      :accept   	accept immediately
;;	:deny		deny immediately
;;	(:accept ipaddress [bits])   accept if left 'bits' of the
;;			ipaddress match
;;	(:deny ipaddress [bits])     deny if the left 'bits' of the 
;;			ipaddress match
;;
;;	bits defaults to 32
;;	the ipaddress can be an
;;		integer -  the 32 bit ip address
;;		string
;;		  "127.0.0.1"  - the dotted notation for an ip address
;;		  "foo.bar.com" - the name of a machine
;;	 when the ipaddress is a string it is converted to an integer
;;	 the first time it is examined.
;;	 When the string is a machine name then the conversion may or
;;	 may not work due to the need to access a nameserver to do
;;	 the lookup.

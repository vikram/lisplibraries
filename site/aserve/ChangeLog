	* main.cl (connection-reset-error): detect sigpipe and
	  "connection reset by peer" on sbcl

	* publish.cl: In http 1.1 keep alive is the default.
	  Client needs to send "Connection: close". In http 1.0
	  non-persistent connection is the default, client
	  needs to send "Connection: keep-alive".

	* main.cl: fixed atomic-{incf,decf} for sbcl

2004-01-09  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.35
	* publish.cl, main.cl, test/t-aserve.cl: add a slot to 
	  all entities holding
	  the extra headers to add to the response.  Add a :headers
	  argument to all publish functions that allows one
	  to store a value in the new headers slot.

1.2.29

	* load.cl,
	* examples/examples.cl,
	* examples/urian.cl: use *load-pathname* instead of
	  *load-truename* since truename in ACL 7.0 goes through symbolic
	  links and this doesn't work in the way aserve is built at franz
	  (via symlinks to source code)

2003-09-04  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.28
	* non-standard http headers are again supported in all

	* doc/aserve.html - clarify that you can have a list of
	    authorization objects in an entity.

	* client.cl - when sending character data obey external formats
	* main.cl - initialize log stream to *initial-terminal-io* since
	  *standard-output* could be bound to something during the loading
	  process.
	* [htmlgen changes, see it's ChangeLog]

2002-09-06  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* detect connection reset by peer on the AIX operating system

	  in an International Lisp with multibyte character input.
	  In certain rare cases it could get stuck decoding the last
	  bits of a buffer.
	  
	  - add :ssl-password argument to net.aserve:start to 
	   specify the password for decrypting the private key
	   in the file with the ssl certificate. [requires
	   acl feature introduced in acl 6.2]2

	* client.cl - if the content passed to do-http-request
	   is a list of vectors, each vector in the list will
	   be sent to the server.
	  

2002-02-28  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.23
>>>	*  incompatible change:
	    The path part of a uri can't contain certain characters
	    unless they are escaped like %xx.  Even characters that
	    needn't be escaped *can* be escaped.  Thus to canonicalize
	    the uri path and to allow it to be easily mapped to filenames
	    we now decode the uri path (convert %xx to the actual character)
	    before processing it (looking for matches in the published
	    entities).   If you had published a path like "foo%20bar"
	    then you must change it to "foo bar".
	 * cgi.cl - add default for :script-name arg
	 * various - open socket in nodelay mode to maximize performance
	    
	

2002-02-13  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	    additional environment variables to be specified.

2002-01-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.21
	* main.cl - fix bug where the value of 
	  *default-aserve-external-format* was captured at macroexpansion
	  time rather than run time.  All code using with-http-body
	  should be recompiled.

	* publish.cl - allow mime types to be specified for filenames that
	  don't have a type component (e.g. ReadMe files).
	* publish.cl - set-cookie-header takes an encode-value argument
	 to control whether it does encoding of its argument.

	 stream has a lock on it's property list.

2001-11-28    <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* add :binary type to publish-multi
	* chat.cl - add the ability to upload pictures

>>>	* incompatible changes:
	  redid the way access files are processed, see the
	  document for the latest spec.
	  notable changes:
	        :ignore is now :deny 
	        :block is gone from :subdirectories but I've added
	             :allow and :deny for fine tuned blocking
	        :inherit now defaults to nil
	        you can have multiple forms of the same kind of 
	        information in a single access file and they will
	        all be used.

2001-11-06  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* fix bug causing infinite loop when reading truncated form body

2001-11-05  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* if AllegroServe isn't setup to proxy it will not match proxy
	  requests with local web pages.

2001-11-05    <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* log.cl - write to log files under the protection of a process
	  lock found on the stream-property-list of the stream associated
	  with the :lock indicator.  If no such lock is found, write
	  to the streame anyway.
	* examples/chat.cl - improve the speed of deleting messages by
	  binary searching the existing messages.

2001-10-31  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.15
	* start now takes a host argument to allow you to bind the server
	  to a specific host
	* publish-multi will not return 304 (not modified) unless the
	  request is a get or a head
	* files published with publish-file will now obey a single
	  range specifier so they will be download accelerator friendly

2001-10-26  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* add entity-plist slot to entities and use it to link
	  file entities to their parent directory entities with
	  the :parent indicator
	* add map-entities function
	* print vhosts in a why that shows their host names

2001-10-24  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.14
	* added access files for publish-directory.  These allow
	  .htaccess-like controlling of what publish-directory publishes.
>>>	* incompatible change: added an extra argument to the 
	  publish-directory filter function and publisher functions.

2001-10-19  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.13
	* added publish-multi 
	* while debugging (:notrap) we ignore connection reset by peer errors
	  by default since they are frequent and not errors in most 
	  cases. You can have them recognized by setting
	  *debug-connection-reset-by-peer*  to t.
	  

2001-10-18  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* The initial log stream (which is used then to initialize vhost
	  log streams) is now *initial-terminal-io* and not
	  *standard-output*.
	* random messages (written by logmess) are now sent to the
	  vhost-error-stream of the default-vhost of the server.
	  This allows one to separate these random messages from the
	  the request logs
	* logs of proxy activity is now sent to the vhost-error-stream
	  of the default-vhost of the server.  we may rethink this later.
	* support vhost specific request filters

2001-10-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* cgi.cl: redo cgi so that it doesn't buffer data... also  
	  can now process standard error from scripts

2001-10-16  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.12
	
>>>	* incompatible change:  the format argument to with-http-body
	  has been moved to with-http-response. 
	  The format argument to with-http-body was ignored, but on
	  with-http-response it will be obeyed and will override
	  the format specified in the entity.
	    
	  The internal generic function compute-strategy now takes
	  three arguments.  This function isn't part of the 
	  external interface to AllegroServe but some users have
	  specialized it.

2001-10-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* add timeout value to each entity object to serve as a default
	  that's checked before the wserver-response-timeout.
	* add a timeout argument to publish functions to set this 
	  entity timeout value.
	* add a publisher argument to publish-directory so users can 
	  control what kind of entity is created when the real file is
	  eventually found.

2001-10-12  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* using socket stream i/o timeouts in acl6.1
	* moved the *http-response-timeout* to a slot in the wserver
	  object so it can be server dependent.
	* documented timeouts in aserve.html
	* added timeout test to t-aserve.cl but disabled running them
	  by default since they take a long time.

2001-10-10  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.11
	* upgraded support for virtual hosts, introducting
	  an object to denote a virtual host so that each
	  virtual host can do its own logging.
	  See aserve.html for details on Virtual Hosts.

2001-10-08  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* publish.cl - publish-directory must pass on host info
		to the publish-files that it does.
	            - unpublish takes a :server argument

1.2.8
	* client.cl: add :skip-body to do-http-request. add test for this.
	* decode.cl: fix form-urlencoded-to-query so that it can
		handle a non simple string (which can be returned under
	        certain circumstances from get-request-body)

2001-08-28  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.7
	* take the default value for the external-format
	  argument from *default-aserve-external-format*.  
	  net.aserve:start sets the value of *default-aserve-external-foramt*
	  in worker threads.

	* parse.cl (split-string): don't get confused by commas inside
		a double quoted header parameter value.

2001-08-24  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

1.2.6
	* main.cl - try harder to prevent debug output from multiple
	    threads from getting jumbled up on the console
	* publish.cl - do a keep-alive connection if the data is a binary
	    stream as long as we know the content length.
	    Add a new internal entity type so that returns of 
	    "304 - Not Modified" can do keep alives too.

2001-08-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.5

	    - specify a catch-all compute-response-stream method so 
	      users adding new entity type don't have to do so.

2001-08-08  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* publish.cl - fix for when no body is given with-http-body
		and thus a string-output-stream is not created.

2001-07-30    <jkf@DEEDEE>

2001-07-19  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.2.3
	* publish.cl 
	  - If publish-file file is changed then invalidate

2001-04-04  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* changed how publish-directory deals with urls that
	  point to directories and not files.  It used to 
	  pretend that you specified an index.html or index.htm
	  file in that directory.  This was bad since relative urls
	  in the index file would not be processed correctly. with
	  the change it now redirects to the index.html or index.htm
	  file so that the browser knows what it's getting.

2001-03-22  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.41
	* add os-processes argument to net.aserve:start

1.1.36
	* client.cl: handle illegal set-cookie headers sent by Netscape's
	  v3 web server.  In a client request Split the single large

	  Add a redirect-methods argument to do-http-request to support
	  more user control of redirection.
	* proxy.cl - many enhancements including connection caching

	redefined version of log-request can specify the local time zone

2000-10-31  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.34
	* add to the list of characters to escape in form-urlencoding
	  those that must be escaped so that the result can be put
	  in the query string of a uri

1.1.30
	*  proxy and cache facilty added.

2000-09-22  Charles A. Cox  <cox@pie>

	* decode.cl: Add :external-format to to uriencode-string.
	* publish.cl: Add :external-format to set-cookie-header.
	* test/t-aserve.cl: Add :external-format tests for
	uri{en,de}code-string.

2000-09-07  Charles A. Cox  <cox@delta>
1.1.29
	
>>>	Note: Many of the functions listed in this log entry have had
	the :external-format argument added.  Documentation has been
	updated

	Note 2:  All changes intended to be upward compatible.  Allegro
	specific changes are marked with #+(and allegro (version>= 6 0)).
	
	*  client.cl: make-http-client-request: add/use external-format
	argument.
	*  decode.cl: uridecode-string, query-to-form-urlencoded,
	encode-form-urlencode, form-urlencoded-to-query: add/use
	external-format argument.
	*  main.cl: with-http-body, request-query: add/use external-format
	argument.
	*  publish.cl: get-cookie-values: add/use external-format
	argument.
	*  examples/examples.cl: Add new international character examples.
	*  test/t-aserve.cl: Add tests for external-format additions.


2000-08-28  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.28
	* client.cl - before doing a redirect close down the existing
	    connection.

2000-08-25  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* fix bug which caused file descriptors to remain open
	  forever if a "connection reset by peer" error occured.
	  Added the ability to track sockets opened by aserve to
	  ensure that they were closed before being gc'ed away.

2000-08-24  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.27
	* rewrote the get-multipart-xxx functions to use an
	  (unsigned-byte 8) buffer since character buffers have
	  issues with international code.   This eliminates the
	  extra <cr><lf> at the end problem with get-multipart-sequence.
	  The file transfer should be faster, especially if you 
	  pass get-multipart-sequence a 4096 byte (unsigned-byte 8) vector.
	
	  !! Eliminte the raw argument from get-multipart-sequence. Now
	  transfers are all 'raw'
	  If a character array is passed to get-multipart-sequence then
	  we just copy into each character the code-char of the 
	  item in the buffer (which corresponds to the latin1-base
	  external format).  We will allow external-format select
	  soon.
	  

2000-08-21  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  add :proxy arg to net.aserve:start so you can enable the proxy
	   when you start the server.
	*  fix test suite to report only legit errors

2000-08-20  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>
1.1.26
	*  Added a proxy capability.  enable-proxy will turn it on.
	   Currently it acts an http/1.0 client and server since that
	   makes it easier to debug. However this does cause 12 test
	   set errors to be reported since it expects to see http/1.1
	   responses. 

2000-08-17  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  implement generalized cons-free header parsing and use it
	   in both the client and server.

	* change the header info returned by do-http-request to
	  also use keywords to describe headers
	  !! non upward compatiable change !!

2000-08-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  fix bug where certain headers were sent twice

2000-08-12  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  name headers by keyword symbols rather than strings
	  !! this change is not upward compatible !!
	
    
2000-08-10  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.25
	*  decode.cl: request-query will now convert items in query
	    strings without values into ("keyname" . "") in the resulting
	    alist.
	*  doc/aserve.html - update doc of request-query and 
	   request-query-value to reflect what happens with null valued
	   query elements

2000-08-09  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  publish.cl: write the transfer encoding as all lowercase 'chunked'
	   since a bug in Mozilla M17 means it will only understand this form.
	*  htmlgen/htmlgen.cl - add the <caption> tag

2000-08-04  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>
1.1.24
	*  examples/chat.cl - add user logins and private messages 
	        between users.

2000-07-31  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  main.cl: if a multipart-mixed body was being sent then
	    note that the request-body has been grabbed.

2000-07-25  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  example/chat.cl - enhanced to support logging into the chat

2000-07-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.22
	
	*  main.cl: incf version 

2000-07-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  examples/chat.cl - sample program that does web based chat

2000-07-14  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* client.cl - now do-http-request will always return a uri object
	    (previously it would return its uri arg unless a redirect
             was done in which case it would return a uri object)

2000-07-01  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* client.cl - handle the "100 continue" response we seem to 
	 get from IIS whenever we do a post.

2000-06-25  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* keep track all of all ip addresses by which the server
	  is contacted (this is simpler than trying to figure them
	  out in advance).
	* add function to find a response object given the code.
	* keep track of the raw uri by which a request was made
	  (as distinguished from the uri in which we've added the
	  host and port values).  This is necessary to distriguish
	  when we must proxy.
	* in html-print assume that attribute values are already html escaped

2000-06-12  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* main.cl: add utility function request-query-value to
		combine getting the query info via request query
		and locating the particular value with assoc

2000-06-08  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.21
	* client.cl - do-http-request: 
	        1. give the redirect arg a numeric
		   value to prevent infinite redirect loops.
	        2. handle two other redirect codes
		3. autoredirect only for get and head
		4. return the uri accessed as the fourth value
	* main.cl - add more response codes
		- handle calls to request-query specifying different
		 uri and post values.
	* examples.cl - add redirect test
	* t-aserve.cl - test redirection
	* doc/aserve.html  - update for changes above
	* doc/tutorial.html - don't be so cookie centric

2000-05-30  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.20
	* macs.cl - add note about where to find the if* macro
	* main.cl - cache result of get-request-body so that it can
		    safely be called more than once inside a response
	            function.   Also be sure to call get-request-body 
	            if the connection is keep-alive and there might 
	            be a body following the headers.
	* t-aserve.cl - test enhancment to get-request-body
	* doc/aserve.html - fix do-http-request documentation to
	            reflect change made in 1.1.18
	            

	
Fri May 26 22:42:12 PST 2000  Duane Rettig  <duane@beta>
1.1.19
	* makefile: set SHELL variable
	* main.cl: incf version
	
2000-05-16  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.18	
	* ! Non upward-compatiable change ! - the function
	   do-http-request returns arguments in a different
	   order, it now returns the body value first, then the
	   response code and then the headers.
	* fixed bug in publish-directory (sourceforge bug 105426)
	* added query and content-type arguments to do-http-request
	  and make-http-client-request.  These make it even easier
	  to send form data to web servers
	
	
2000-05-16  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.17


	* in order to make portions of the LGPL license meaningful
	  for a Lisp program we've added a prequel to the license
	  agreement in the file license-allegroserve.txt.

2000-05-16  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* client.cl
	  - increase header reading buffer size - but we should
	    make this growable.
	  - handle cookies with = signs embedded
	* decode.cl 
	  - in query-to-form-urlencoded all the values to
	    be non-strings and in that case use ~a format to stringify them
        * parse.cl 
	  - add arg to utility function
	
2000-05-04  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.16
	* request-query can now read from uri and/or post'ed body
	  see doc/aserve.html for details

2000-04-26  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.15
	* ! Non upward-compatible change ! -- the function
	    decode-form-urlencoded has been renamed
	    form-urlencoded-to-query so as to match its new inverse
	    function: query-to-form-urlencoded

	* added query-to-form-urlencoded to allow one to encode
	  query to strings for use by client code.

2000-04-24  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.14
	* verify that it works in acl501 trial (Linux)

2000-04-24    <jkf@CROW>

	* load.cl: make aServe load in acl5.0.1 Lite (Windows) but
	   be advised that it doesn't work very well due to socket
	   problems that can be patched in the Lite version.

	* main.cl: the default timeout for a with-http-response
		now comes from *http-response-timeout* and it
		now defaults to 120 seconds rather than 60.
	
	* some documention updates

2000-04-23  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* client.cl - added proxy argument so that client requests
	    can go through a proxy
	* various doc fixes

2000-04-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.13
	* rename Allegro iServe to AllegroServe.

1.1.12

	* add test/t-iserve.cl to the list of files in the ftp distribution

2000-04-16    <jkf@DEEDEE>

	* debug-on and debug-off are no longer exported symbols.
	  They continue to exist but you have to use
          net.iserve::debug-on and net.iserve::debug-off to reach them.

	* added two new response type symbols to aid in doing redirections:
	    *response-moved-permanently*
	    *response-temporary-redirect*
	  note that netscape 4 doesn't understand *response-temporary-redirect*
          as that's a http/1.1 thing.
	
	* request-query takes a :handle-post keyword arguments.  When true
	  (and that's the default) it will automatically read,
	  extract, parse and cache the query string from the entity body
	  when the request is a post request.
	  
2000-03-28  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* move htmlgen.html from htmlgen/ to doc/ so that it's in
	  a consistent place regardless of distribution type.

2000-04-08    <jkf@DEEDEE>
1.1.11
	* make the debugging output feature based rather than
	  numeric. see  net.iserve:debug-on
	* properly do client queries
	* use setfable reply-header-slot-value to read and set 
	  headers for the reply that will be sent
	* always send back HTTP/1.1 as our protocol

	  to allow you to add headers
	* fix client requests for :head so it doesn't wait for a body
	  to be returned
	* fix debugging output when running inside emacs
	* add client info to documentation.
	
2000-03-27  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* add net.iserve::*trap-errors* (default t).  If set to
	  nil then errors in http processing by iserve will result
	  in error break loops.

	* fixed errors in publish-directory.  Also prevent user from
	passing ../ in urls to access above the published directory

	  for a file that doesn't exist would cause browser to hang
	  until the socket was closed

2000-03-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.4
	* change source-readme.txt and load.cl so that

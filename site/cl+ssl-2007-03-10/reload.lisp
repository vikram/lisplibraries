;;; We do this in an extra file so that it happens
;;;   - after the asd file has been loaded, so that users can
;;;     customize *libssl-pathname* between loading the asd and LOAD-OPing
;;;     the actual sources
;;;   - before ssl.lisp is loaded, which needs the library at compilation
;;;     time on some implemenations
;;;   - but not every time ffi.lisp is re-loaded as would happen if we
;;;     put this directly into ffi.lisp

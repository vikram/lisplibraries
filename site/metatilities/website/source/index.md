### What it is

Utilities, utilities, utilities!

Everyone needs utilities and until things like [cl-utilities][8] get going (and probably even after!), projects need to have them nearby. Metatilities is [metabang.com][9]'s set of core utilities. It includes much of what you might expect and other stuff too. These are used in [CL-Containers][10], [CL-Graph][11], [CL-MathStats][12], [CL-Variates][13], and [TINAA][14]. You are welcome to use them too. Some documentation is [available][15] and more is on the way.

### Where is it

A [darcs][] repository is available. You'll need [Moptilities][18] too. The commands to get them are listed below:

    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/metatilities
    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/moptilities

Metatilities is [ASDF installable][19]. Its CLiki home is right [where][20] you'd expect.

There's also a handy [gzipped tar file][21].
